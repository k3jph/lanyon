_You've had a couple of days' warning, but it's never enough. You
have half the plywood you need, and don't know how high the water
will get this time. The evacuation order was just announced…_

Into every life some rain must fall…but when a lot of rain falls
all at once, you may find yourself in the eye of the storm. _GURPS
Disasters: Hurricane_ is your guide to one of the most devastating
forces that nature can unleash. It includes information on the
science of hurricanes, a discussion of what makes these phenomena
dangerous, and a look at a few of the most noteworthy historical
storms. It also includes ideas for how to endure and survive during
this cacophonous crisis, and gives suggestions for working one into
your campaigns set in the past, present, and future. This supplement
puts the "story" in "stormy!"
