Online education has grown to be a major component of the higher
education market in both the United States and worldwide.  Students
take entire degree programs online or selected courses online for
convenience.   In addition, many instructors have adopted online
resources to support face-to-face instruction, either as a supplement
or through "flipping-the-classroom," which pushes most instruction
outside the traditional classroom.  Teaching and learning online
introduces a number of complications ranging from effective assessment
to managing student engagement.  In mathematics and statistics
courses, these complications emphasize already existing difficulties
in working with students with math anxiety, the abstractness of the
material, and notation.

_Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online_ (_TLMO_) will bridge
these issues and present meaningful solutions for teaching and
learning mathematics online.  _TLMO_ will focus on the problems
seen by mathematics instructors working in the field and provide a
set of standard practices which have demonstrated their use and
viability to improve the quality of online mathematics instruction.
This book will include chapters that present interactive demonstration
techniques, address the divide between students with access to
varying levels of technology, familiarity and comfort with mathematical
content, and methods for developing reliable and rigorous assessment
techniques across digital connections.  We believe this will enhance
our ability as educators to reach students and successfully instruct
in a subject with well-known difficulties.

Instructors will benefit from learning new techniques and approaches
to delivering mathematical content.  Their students will benefit
from the new techniques presented as students are better able to
assimilate and apply the material.  Finally, we expect our readers
will find better methods to work with students across skill levels.
