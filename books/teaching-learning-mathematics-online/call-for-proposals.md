## Introduction

Online education has grown to be a major component of the higher
education market in both the United States and worldwide.  Students
take entire degree programs online or selected courses online for
convenience.   In addition, many instructors have adopted online
resources to support face-to-face instruction, either as a supplement
or through "flipping-the-classroom," which pushes most instruction
outside the traditional classroom.    Teaching and learning online
introduces a number of complications ranging from effective assessment
to managing student engagement.  In mathematics and statistics
courses, these complications emphasize already existing difficulties
in working with students with math anxiety, the abstractness of the
material, and notation.

_Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online_ (_TLMO_) will bridge
these issues and present meaningful solutions for teaching and
learning mathematics online.  _TLMO_ will focus on the problems
seen by mathematics instructors working in the field and provide a
set of standard practices which have demonstrated their use and
viability to improve the quality of online mathematics instruction.
This book will include chapters that present interactive demonstration
techniques, address the divide between students with access to
varying levels of technology, familiarity and comfort with mathematical
content, and methods for developing reliable and rigorous assessment
techniques across digital connections.  We believe this will enhance
our ability as educators to reach students and successfully instruct
in a subject with well-known difficulties.

Instructors will benefit from learning new techniques and approaches
to delivering mathematical content.  Their students will benefit
from the new techniques presented as students are better able to
assimilate and apply the material.  Finally, we expect our readers
will find better methods to work with students across skill levels.

## Objectives of the Book

The objective of _TLMO_ is to provide a set of practice standards
for educators teaching mathematics and statistics in the online and
hybrid environments.  The text will present sound methods for
delivering mathematical content to students grounded in both the
research and practice of mathematics education.  It will also present
methods and tools for integrating online material to students in
the traditional classroom.

We will welcome chapters that focus on empirical research, theoretical
frameworks, or detailed case studies showing what works in the
classroom.  We are also interested chapters that provide content
for international education, especially to students in the developing
world.  As a whole, _TLMO_ should provide a framework for developing,
implementing, and teaching online mathematics and statistics courses
to students across disciplines and skill levels.

## Target Audience

The target audience for _TLMO_ are practicing educators, at the
high school, collegiate, and postgraduate level.  These educators
are familiar with mathematics and statistical instruction, but may
be new to the online or hybrid classroom.  These educations may
also be interested in integrating online instruction in the traditional
classroom.  In addition to practicing educators, _TLMO_ will also
appeal to mathematics education researchers and instructors of other
natural sciences who must integrate mathematical and statistical
content into online and hybrid courses.  The volume will be a
handbook of methods and practices for teaching excellence across
mathematical courses.

## Suggested Topics

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

* Teaching nontraditional students such as adult learners, working students, or high school students
* Reaching students with math anxiety
* Integrating online resources within the face-to-face classroom
* Writing across the curriculum: integrating written assignments
* Meaningful strategies for assessment and outcomes measurement
* Teaching statistics courses online or using hybrid methods
* Teaching upper-level and specialty undergraduate courses
* Developing interactive demonstrations for the online classroom
* Teaching statistics and/or research methods to graduate students in professional programs
* Using social media to the online or face-to-face classrooms
* The use and influence of MOOCs in online mathematics instruction
* Synchronous versus asynchronous instruction
* Mathematics outside of math courses, such as physics, computer science, or data analysis
* Teaching students using mobile online education platforms
* Integrating open educational resources in the online classroom
* Managing quality assurance, including student identity and authentication
* Challenges unique to mathematics and statistics online

Other topic areas related to teaching mathematics online will be
welcomed.

## Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit their chapter
proposals. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind
review basis. Contributors may also be requested to serve as reviewers
for this project. This publication is anticipated to be released
in 2019.

Proposals, chapters, and inquiries should be submitted to James P.
Howard, II <<james.howard@jhu.edu>>. There is no template for the
proposals. However, they should clearly describe the topic of the
chapter, and list the tentative sections alongside a rough estimate
of their lengths. Proposals should also include authors' information
(names, affiliations, email addresses, and short bios).

**Note**: There are no submission or acceptance fees for manuscripts
submitted to this book publication. All manuscripts are accepted
based on a double-blind peer-review editorial process.

### Publisher

CRC Press, Florida, USA, is a premier global publisher of science,
technology, and medical resources. CRC Press is a member of Taylor
& Francis Group. For additional information regarding the publisher,
please visit their website at <<https://www.crcpress.com>>.

### Important Dates

* September 30, 2017: Chapter proposals due
* December 15, 2017: Contributors will be notified and selected authors invited to participate
* August 31, 2018: First submission of chapters
* November 30, 2018: Initial chapter review and authors asked to revise if appropriate
* January 31, 2019: Final chapter submission
* Mid 2019: Publication

### Manuscript Submission

A chapter is recommended to be approximately 30 double-spaced 8x11
or A4 pages with one-inch margins.  Longer or shorter chapters are
fine. Chapters should be proofread, polished and formatted according
to the publisher's instructions before submission.  Submissions
should be made using Microsoft Word 2013 or later.  Authorâ€™s
guidelines and chapter template will be available to accepted
authors.
