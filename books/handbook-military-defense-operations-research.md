Operations research (OR) is a core discipline in military and defense
management. Coming to the forefront initially during World War II,
OR provided critical contributions to managing supply chains and
strategic simulation, as well as enabled superior management for
Allied forces. Since these early days, OR has grown to include
analytics and many applications, including artificial intelligence,
cybersecurity, and big data, and is the cornerstone of management
science in manufacturing, advertising, telecommunications, and many
other fields. In _Handbook of Military and Defense Operations
Research_ (_MDOR_), we will present the voices leading OR and
analytics to new heights in security through research, practical
applications, and lessons learned in the field.

No longer constrained to printed tables and traditional optimization
problems, OR and analytics support a dynamic problem space that has
applications to national security, policing, cyberspace, foreign
policy, terrorism, and homeland security. Because of this, there
is a critical need for students, practitioners, military, and
security analysts to understand the problem space, best practices,
and lessons learned from actual problems. Contextual milieu is key
to supporting cutting edge analysis that transforms national security
and supports both traditional and emerging military operations
research and analytics applications.

Instructors will benefit from this text through examples and case
studies that can be utilized directly in an OR classroom. Students
will benefit from access to hands on and practical experience from
writers in the field. Regardless of background, readers of _MDOR_
will find solutions for problems facing the security and defense
space every day.
