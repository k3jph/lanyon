## Introduction

Operations research (OR) is a core discipline in military and defense
management. Coming to the forefront initially during World War II,
OR provided critical contributions to managing supply chains and
strategic simulation, as well as enabled superior management for
Allied forces. Since these early days, OR has grown to include
analytics and many applications, including artificial intelligence,
cybersecurity, and big data, and is the cornerstone of management
science in manufacturing, advertising, telecommunications, and many
other fields. In _Handbook of Military and Defense Operations
Research_ (_MDOR_), we will present the voices leading OR and
analytics to new heights in security through research, practical
applications, and lessons learned in the field.

No longer constrained to printed tables and traditional optimization
problems, OR and analytics support a dynamic problem space that has
applications to national security, policing, cyberspace, foreign
policy, terrorism, and homeland security. Because of this, there
is a critical need for students, practitioners, military, and
security analysts to understand the problem space, best practices,
and lessons learned from actual problems. Contextual milieu is key
to supporting cutting edge analysis that transforms national security
and supports both traditional and emerging military operations
research and analytics applications.

Instructors will benefit from this text through examples and case
studies that can be utilized directly in an OR classroom. Students
will benefit from access to hands on and practical experience from
writers in the field. Regardless of background, readers of _MDOR_
will find solutions for problems facing the security and defense
space every day.

## Objectives of the Book

The objective of this book is to provide a set of case studies,
essays, and positional papers to illustrate application of operations
research and analytics techniques within the military, national
defense, and homeland security sectors. The content can then be
used by educators to facilitate and enhance classroom discussion
as well as by practitioners for guidance on best practices.

In the public and military sectors, many traditional business
analyses can no longer be directly applied. For instance, supply
chains are at substantial risk, reputation risk is a larger concern,
and military personnel have a different relationship with the
organization. This book aims to bridge this gap, demonstrating
context for security and defense applications, and matching existing
theoretical frameworks with this application area.

We welcome chapters that focus on applications of empirical research
and theoretical frameworks, or generalized case studies illustrating
model development, best practices, lessons learned, and obstacles
achieved within the unique military and defense environment. We
also welcome submissions that apply existing research to these
sectors.

## Target Audience

The target audience for _MDOR_ is undergraduate students and early
career practitioners in operations research and analytics, to
facilitate understanding of the use of operations research and
analytics in defense and security practice. Students at military
service academies may especially benefit from a collection of cases
and best practices. Furthermore, practitioners in government and
military roles, both civilians and contractors, as well as military
service members assigned to operations research and systems analysis
(ORSA) roles will benefit from the book's contextual examples and
collection of best practices.

## Suggested Topics

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Security of supply chains
*   Big data analytics
*   Forecasting and predictive analysis
*   Conflict modeling
*   Planning and scheduling decisions
*   Process optimization
*   Workforce planning
*   Operational readiness
*   Utility and value based decisions
*   Systems analysis, design, and testing
*   Cyber defense
*   Cost-benefit analyses
*   Risk assessment and mitigation
*   Social network applications
*   Attacker-defender games
*   Acquisition/procurement risk
*   Financial management via OR
*   Maintenance and reliability
*   Soft skills and contract management

Other topic areas related to applications of operations research
and analytics within the military and national security areas will
be welcomed.

## Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit their chapter
proposals. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind
review basis. Contributors may also be requested to serve as reviewers
for this project. This publication is anticipated to be released
in early 2020.

Chapter proposals should be submitted through this webform:

*   <[http://bit.ly/MDORAbstracts](http://bit.ly/MDORAbstracts)>

The form requests contact information, a list of authors, and a
600-800 word extended abstract of the proposed chapter. Accepted
chapters should be 10,000 words or fewer. Author guidelines and a
chapter template will be available to accepted authors.

**Note:** There are no submission or acceptance fees for manuscripts
submitted to this book publication. All manuscripts are accepted
based on a double-blind peer-review editorial process.
