In _Socioeconomic Effects of the National Flood Insurance Program_,
I estimate the net the social benefit of the NFIP for the years
1996 through 2010, including the estimated consumer surplus for
flood insurance using historical financial and survey data available
from the NFIP. Using this estimate and other components of net
social benefits, this analysis derives a sufficient statistic for
the insurance component of the NFIP and is joined with other estimates
of the benefits of the FMA to estimate the net social benefits of
the combined program. A supplemental analysis is done using different
income weighting scenarios in a distributionally weighted benefit-cost
analysis. Finally, this study includes an analysis of the change
in government revenue attributable to the NFIP and FMA programs.
Sensitivity analysis is conducted on all results. Presented through
each component of the analysis are models usable by others for
extending and revising the analysis, or applying to other programs.

The primary audience of this text are policymakers, non-governmental
organization representatives, and academics working on flood-related
issues. This includes those studying the effects of floods on
populations, academics working on similar issues relating to natural
disasters, generally, and policymakers working on NFIP reform.
