## Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R

{% include figure.html image="CMNA-cover-300.png"  cap="" width="240" align="right" link="/cmna"
   alt="Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R book cover" %}

This book is a treatment of the traditional numerical analysis
course using R as the underlying programming language. The traditional
numerical analysis outline begins with numerical error, then linear
algebra, interpolation, integration, optimization, and differential
equations. In this way, the outline covers the entire introductory
mathematical sequence. This text will be suitable for the advanced
undergraduate student or first-year graduate student. The book will
require a solid understanding of linear algebra, differential and
integral calculus, and differential equations. Students of mathematics,
computer science, physics, engineering, and other mathematically
intensive disciplines will have sufficient background to read and
understand the book.

## Socioeconomic Effects of the National Flood Insurance Program

   alt="Socioeconomic Effects of the National Flood Insurance Program book cover" %}

In this book, I estimate the net the social benefit of the NFIP for
the years 1996 through 2010, including the estimated consumer surplus
for flood insurance using historical financial and survey data
available from the NFIP. Using this estimate and other components
of net social benefits, this analysis derives a sufficient statistic
for the insurance component of the NFIP and is joined with other
estimates of the benefits of the FMA to estimate the net social
benefits of the combined program. A supplemental analysis is done
using different income weighting scenarios in a distributionally
weighted benefit-cost analysis. Finally, this study includes an
analysis of the change in government revenue attributable to the
NFIP and FMA programs. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on all
results. Presented through each component of the analysis are models
usable by others for extending and revising the analysis, or applying
to other programs.


## Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research

Operations research (OR) is a core discipline in military and defense
management. Coming to the forefront initially during World War II,
OR provided critical contributions to managing supply chains,
strategic simulation, and enabled superior management for Allied
forces. Since these early days, OR has grown to include analytics
and many applications, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
and big data, and is the cornerstone of management science in
manufacturing, advertising, telecommunications, and many other
fields. In _Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research_ (_MDOR_),
we will present the voices leading OR and analytics to new heights
in security through research, practical applications, and lessons
learned in the field.

This book is co-edited with [Natalie M.
Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com/), associate professor of
business analytics and technology management at [Towson

## Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online
### Edited with John F. Beyers

Online education has grown to be a major component of the higher
education market in both the United States and worldwide. Students
take entire degree programs online or selected courses online for
convenience. In addition, many instructors have adopted online
resources to support face-to-face instruction, either as a supplement
or through flipping-the-classroom, which pushes most instruction
outside the traditional classroom. Teaching and learning online
introduces a number of complications ranging from effective assessment
to managing student engagement. In mathematics and statistics
courses, these complications emphasize already existing difficulties
in working with students with math anxiety, the abstractness of the
material, and notation. We will bridge these issues and present
meaningful solutions for teaching and learning mathematics online.

This book is co-edited with [John F.
Beyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-beyers-ph-d-8948a59/),
program chair for mathematics and statistics at the [University of
Maryland Global Campus](http://www.umuc.edu/).
