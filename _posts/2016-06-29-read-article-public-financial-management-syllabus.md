Excellent news, everyone.  My paper, "Public Financial Management"
has just been published by _Syllabus_, an open access and peer-reviewed
journal that publishes original syllabi, assessment instruments,
assignments and activities, and articles related to college teaching.
The paper here focused on my public financial management class,
PUAD 701 [at the University of Baltimore](/teaching).

In that course, we developed an original nonprofit organization to
provide a hands-on tool for students to use to learn about the
financial management process.  While our nonprofit was ultimately
not successful, the lessons learned and general approach may help
other financial management professors in developing their courses.
In addition, the course could be scaled down and used to teach
financial management even at the high school level.  If you do this,
let me know, as I'd like to hear more.

In the mean time, you can get the original article, for free, from
_Syllabus_:
