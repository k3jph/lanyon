As climate change progresses, one of the most obvious effects will
be the increasing temperature, overall.  That's why we call it
global warming.  Right now, the [IPCC predicts global mean temperature
increase of 2 degrees Celsius](http://www.wri.org/ipcc-infographics)
by the year 2100.  Most people focus on the effects of rising ocean.
But I gotta say, it's the rising temperature that's got me worried.
See, I like the cold.  I am not happy unless I see a [penguin wearing
a sweater](http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/penguins.asp).

So how are we going to adapt to rising temperatures, other than
cranking up the air conditioning?  Two degrees C doesn't sound like
much.  The temperature varies more than that most days here in the
Mid-Atlantic.  But some think that humans will have difficulty
adapting.  Matthew Huber, of Purdue, [thinks the temperature will
increase up to 10 degrees
C](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/will-the-human-body-be-able-to-adapt-to-rising-temperatures/255223/).
On a hot day in Baltimore, the average August temperature is 85
degrees Fahrenheit.  10 degrees C takes that to 102 degrees F.
That's the average, not record; the August record in Baltimore is
105.  Imagine where that's going.

So Huber thinks the best way to adapt will be through air conditioning
but notes that power failures may be lethal.  Further, the poor
will be forced to flee.  Like other climate disasters, whether
natural or not, the [poorer among us will be worst
off](/2015/06/04/wealthier-communities-pay-less-for-flood-insurance/).  If
you can buy yourself a better situation, you will.

We'll see problems with agriculture, too.  Previously verdant fields
will become deserts.  Tundra will become arable.  And this is
starting to happen already.  [Britain has seen
egrets](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/8708873/Climate-change-pushing-animals-further-north.html),
previously only seen on the European mainland.  And in the United
States, [trees are moving
northward](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/go-west-my-sap/526899/).

The farmers will have to be next.  And that's how climate change
will most affect people.  They will be forced northward (there isn't
enough land to the south) to keep cool enough for comfort, safety,
and food.  But people can only go so far.  Usable land will also
diminish due to rising sea levels.  All in all, there isn't a lot
of good news here.
