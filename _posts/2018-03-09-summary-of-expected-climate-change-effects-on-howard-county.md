Howard County is largely insulated from the most dramatic effect
of global climate change, sea level rise.  Howard County has no
coastal border and is sufficiently inland and above sea level that
even substantial sea level rise will not touch Howard County's land.
However, it borders Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties, both of
which have extensive coastline along the Chesapeake Bay.  Accordingly,
knock-on effects from reduced land area in both counties will affect
Howard County.

All of Maryland can [expect to see increased rainfall from extreme
storms](http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Air/ClimateChange/Documents/FINAL-Chapt%202%20Impacts_web.pdf).
These storms will lead to increased flooding, including flash floods
risking both life and property.  These storms have already come to
Howard County with the [worst flood on record in Ellicott
City](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/ellicott-city-a-town-of-many-many-floods/2016/07/31/94f05032-575e-11e6-9767-f6c947fd0cb8_story.html?utm_term=.3cbda89764d8)
occurring in 2016, and will only intensify in both severity and
frequency.

Like everywhere else, Howard County will see a temperature rise
associated with global warming.  Warmer summers and winters will
have several important side effects, most notably a change in the
growing season, which will lengthen.  However, there will also be
changes associated with migratory patterns and the habitable ranges
for some plants and animals.  This can take the ecosystem out of
balance if predatory-prey relationships are affected by these range
changes.

Habitable range changes will also have a direct effect on human
health as animal-borne disease vectors are moved to new and different
areas.  West Nile virus has been linked to areas experiencing drought
followed by severe rainfall, an extreme weather cycle that is driven
by climate change.

Quantitatively, it is easier to understand exactly how great the
risk is for Howard County.  With respect to rainfall, models predict
that by 2100, there will be an increase in overall rainfall as
measured by the precipitation anomaly. This increase is likely to
be in the 10-15 inch range, though it is possible it could exceed
an extra 15 inches of rainfall per year.  In addition, during the
preceding 100 years, days of extreme rainfall, have increased by 7
percent.  Further, under increasing levels of emissions, models
show an increase in the size of 1-, 10-, and 100-year recurrence
levels for precipitation amounts.  For instance, the current 100-year
recurrence level is 10-20 percent higher at the higher expected
emissions rate.  All in all, more rain will be coming, faster.

Beyond increased rainfall, Howard County will likely see increased
temperatures.  The low emissions prediction for the temperature
increase is 4.8 degrees (Fahrenheit) and 4.0 degrees (Fahrenheit)
in the winter.  At higher project emissions rates, Howard County
will see a 9 degree (Fahrenheit) rise during the summer and 7 degrees
(Fahrenheit) in the winter.  These temperature increases are also
observed to be happening and it is important to remember that the
4.0 degrees listed for the low emissions prediction are essentially
the same as the famous 2 degrees (Centigrade) metric [issued by the
IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf).

The predictions
for Howard County are stark, as they are everywhere else.  Temperatures
will rise, increasing the already severe Maryland summer at least
four degrees on average.  In addition, rising temperatures will
increase winter temperatures, too.  Over time, this will alter the
patterns of crops we can plant in Howard County, force adjustments
to school schedules due to increased heat in school buildings, and
our children will lose the memory of a white Christmas.

In addition, increased flooding will continue to plague already
at-risk areas.  In Ellicott City, built directly upon the Patapsco
River, this will damage stores and homes in the historic district.
In Columbia, there is additional risk along the Middle Patuxent
River, going through town.  Columbia as built to place homes outside
the 100-year floodplain, but if climate change forces a change in
the floodplain, previously laid plans are no longer effective.
