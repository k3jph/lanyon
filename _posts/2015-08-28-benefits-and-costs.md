Yesterday's post referred to "benefit-cost analysis" which is the same as what a lot of people call "cost-benefit analysis."  I chose this term for the reason anyone does anything.  When I took [ECON 605](https://highpoint-prd.ps.umbc.edu/app/catalog/showCourse/UMBC1/053388/GRAD), the course was called "Benefit-Cost Evaluation."  Also, I took the course from [Scott Farrow](http://economics.umbc.edu/scott-farrow/), who later suffered greatly as my advisor.

But he told it like this, during class.  "Benefit-cost analysis" puts the fundamental equation of benefit-cost analysis right into the title.  "Cost-benefit" gets it backwards.  The field itself is pretty well split on the matter.  The leading textbook, _[Cost-Benefit Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Cost-Benefit-Analysis-4th-Pearson-Economics/dp/0137002696/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1440590305&sr=8-3&keywords=boardman&pebp=1440590308776&perid=158WJDE5NFVBMEWPZCR8)_ by Boardman, Greenberg, Vining, and Weimer uses one version of the name.  But the main society for the field, [Society of Benefit-Cost Analysis](http://benefitcostanalysis.org/).

And the history of Google searches shows that most prefer "cost-benefit analysis" at around 8 to 1:

But I learned one way in grad school and like a lot of people who get into habits in grad school, I never left this one behind.
