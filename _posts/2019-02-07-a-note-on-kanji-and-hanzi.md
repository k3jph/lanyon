This is a really fun little narrow bit of amusement I got out of
this, but it is worth sharing. I was watching a video from LangFocus
about kanji. I really like the presenter, and this is a neat video:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SX3h9irApwg">The Complexity of Kanji</a></h4><p>(null)</p></blockquote>

But never one to watch just one video when one can watch 40, I also
watched his video on Mandarin versus Cantonese:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2km_z4-1T8">How Similar Are Mandarin and Cantonese?</a></h4><p>(null)</p></blockquote>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

About a third of the way through that video the word for hànzì
appears on the screen. And this is what I love, in Simplified
Chinese, the word for hànzì is 汉字. And in Japanese, the word for
kanji is 漢字. Hmm, now I know that kanji literally means "Chinese
characters," but it is still awesome to see that word for character
appear in both language's names for their own writing.

But wait, that's not all. I posted the Simplified Chinese, which
was developed in the early 20th century. This is [long after kanji
was imported to
Japan](http://travel-around-japan.com/blog/japanese-lesson-4-kanji-japansese-character-set-3/).
The Traditional Chinese form of hànzì is 漢字. Different characters.
Different mappings on my screen. But they look the same.

It all makes sense, but it is kind of cool to see in action.
