I was doing an interview recently on how much mathematics is necessary
for a graduate.  This is all sort of prompted by Andrew Hacker's
book, _The Math Myth_, but more on that in a later post.  I realized,
the story of how I became a math professor is kind of surreal.  So
I wanted to share it.

Back in April 2010, I am minding my own business (or, let's just
assume so), when I got an email saying "Thank you for expressing
your interest in teaching at the University of Maryland University
College..." and asking for a transcript and references.  Except,
and I am reasonably sure of this, I don't think I ever expressed
an interest.  But I was all like, of course this is something I
want to do, and got the ball rolling on transcripts and references.

Now, I am thinking this is for either economics or political science.
I had completed the MPA program two year or so earlier and just
become ABD at UMBC in public policy.  UMUC doesn't have a public
policy program, but UMBC's policy program is an interdisciplinary
program grounded in economics, sociology, and political science.
So heading to one of the home departments made sense to me.

Then, six weeks later, I get an invitation from Professors Andy Au
and John Beyers of the math department for an interview.  This made
some sense since my undergraduate degree from Maryland was in
mathematics.  But it was still a bit surprising.  I accepted the
interview and I was hired officially on July 12, 2010.  I went
through training in the fall and taught my first two classes in the
spring of 2011.

I've also [taught in the public administration program at the
University of Baltimore](/teaching/), but the overwhelming amount
of my teaching has been in bread-and-butter mathematics.  It's been
an amazing journey [just about six years in](/2016/06/20/five-years-umuc/),
and I plan to keep going for as many more as I can.
