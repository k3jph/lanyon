One of the comments I made in my candidate's questionnaire for the
Columbia Flier was that the new CA President needed to heal relations
with stakeholders across Columbia.  But who is a stakeholder in
Columbia?

The term "stakeholder" has been used by those in Columbia to describe
a diverse conglomeration of people and organizations:  CA staff,
Village staff, Villages, Village Boards, volunteers for CA and
Villages, property owners, renters, and others who live, work, and
play in Columbia.  What has recently been renamed "Building a Better
Columbia" has historically been called Stakeholder's Advance--a
meeting of the CA and Village Boards, and staff from the eleven
organizations, to kick off each new fiscal year.

I would add to the definition of stakeholder.  Students who attend
area schools are stakeholders, even though they may be minors.
Those who use CA facilities are stakeholders.  Howard Community
College students, who come from across the County, are stakeholders--they
certainly come into Columbia for class and have an enormous impact
on the adjacent neighborhoods on Town Center and Harper's Choice.

Which brings me to my concern about how CA interacts with all
stakeholders.  CA all too often shoots itself in the foot by failing
to communicate with stakeholders and failing to treat stakeholders
with respect, resulting in wasted resources and damaged relations.

Today (April 18th) was Columbia Cleanup.  The idea for the event
was fantastic--groups of volunteers would simultaneously gather in
their home Villages to clean up trash for a couple of hours.  However,
planning, organization, and advertising for the event left a lot
to be desired.  The press release for the event was distributed on
April 2nd, a mere 16 days before the event.  No email address or
website with information was given, only a telephone number at CA,
which rings during business hours.  No outreach appears to have
happened with local schools (where students must earn community
service hours for graduation) or the local community college.  The
press release stated that the Villages were co-hosts of the event,
however, the Villages were not consulted regarding dates, logistics,
or given enough lead time to help advertise the event.  In Long
Reach, notification could have gone out in Reach Out, through calls
to long term volunteers, or over the website.

I showed up, as did a few of my campaign volunteers.  Aside from
my group, there was only two other volunteers from Long Reach--longstanding
environmental volunteers who had participated in the Kings Contrivance
tree planting earlier this month.  A number of people who wished
to volunteer, and who carry trash bags on the path daily, were
unable to due to lack of notice.  Given the busy schedule for weekend
events April, and the sixteen day lead time, no Village staff were
able to attend.  Local high school students were not given enough
time to organize.  While we cleaned up a lot of trash, I do wonder
if it was worth the CA resources in planning the event.  Indeed,
for no cost except better planning, CA could have vastly increased
turnout.
