Nina asked me about Miamisburg, Ohio, recently. In 1986, I lived
about 35 miles away from Miamisburg when a [CSX train
derailed](http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Miamisburg,_Ohio,_Train_Derailment),
releasing a toxic cloud over a large part of the region. Separate
cars carrying phosphorus, molten sulfur, tallow, and other fun stuff
all started to leak into the Bear Creek. You can see a 2-minute
retrospective from 2012 on Youtube:

And here's another:

This led to 50,000 people evacuated and many more put on notice of
a potential evacuation.

The big problem here is these cars were carrying chemicals that
alone were dangerous, but when mixed, became a nightmare. This is
the old joke about how sodium alone is highly volatile and chlorine
is a poison gas used during World War I, but together they make
[table salt](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-table-salt-604008).
Keeping dangerous combinations apart means more than keeping them
in different tanks.
