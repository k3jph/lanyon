Effective today, I received a promotion at the [University of
Maryland Global Campus](https://www.umuc.edu/), which until yesterday,
is what we called "University of Maryland University College." I've
been teaching for 9 years at UMGC, and was promoted to [Adjunct
Assistant Professor in
2015](https://jameshoward.us/2015/02/23/umuc-adjunct-assistant-professor/).
In case you want to know what this means, I think this comic
summarizes it nicely.
