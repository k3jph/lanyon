Good news, everyone!

I've been accepted to participate in the [NASA
Social](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/social/index.html) program on
November 3rd, in a day called "[Space
Lasers](https://www.nasa.gov/social/see-nasa-goddard-s-space-lasers)."
This is going to be awesome and I will spend the day at [Goddard
Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) and:

* Tour the facility where the laser instrument on NASA's
[ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satellite – called
ATLAS, for Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System – is undergoing
testing before its 2018 launch
* See the [Global Ecosystem and Dynamics
Investigation](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/gedi) (GEDI –
pronounced "Jedi") instrument as it is being built. GEDI launches
in 2019 to the International Space Station, where it will obtain
NASA’s first high-resolution laser ranging observations of the 3D
structure of Earth.
* Learn how all different types of NASA engineers and scientists
use lasers for everything from studying the Earth, to space
communications, to guiding robotic servicing missions.
* Experience one of NASA’s current communications networks in 360
degrees using virtual reality glasses and see a demonstration of
laser communications technology. Participants will learn about how
NASA plans to use lasers to communicate with spacecraft in the
future.
* Visit Goddard's [laser ranging
facility](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/LROatmoon_02.html)
at night to see a ground laser measure the paths of Earth-orbiting
satellites, supporting both Earth science and missions.

Listen, I said space lasers.  So follow me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/howardjp) or
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/k3jph/) to get more of space
lasers than anyone can take on November 3rd and the following days.
