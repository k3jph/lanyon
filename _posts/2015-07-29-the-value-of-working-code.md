I submitted a review last night to the [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org).  Despite being a journal for statisticians, much of what happens in JSS is code.  Lots and lots of code.  And I realized, as I wrote my review, that I place a premium on working examples in a book, especially a textbook.  A good book on programming, or anything closely related, needs to have a lot of well thought out, and working, examples to drive it.  And last night's review is not even the [first time I have brought this issue up on the pages of JSS](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/b03/paper).  

Part of this is [the Hacker Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).  Part of this is the Agile ethic of [working code over documentation](http://agilemanifesto.org/), though a good book should do both.  And, preferably, the code should be [unencumbered](http://www.nr.com/licenses/).
