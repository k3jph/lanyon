_The New Yorker_ has a [story on how](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/five-hundred-and-twenty-days-of-solitude) the Mars500 crew kept themselves occupied.  The [Mars500 expedition](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Mars500/Welcome_back_and_thank_you_Mars500) placed six people in a capsule, here on Earth, for 500 days, to see how they could withstand the isolation.  The goal was to simulate a round trip from Earth to Mars and back.  Apparently, there was a lot of reading, but

While the Russian researcher Alexander Smoleevskiy did bring a copy of “War and Peace,” he said that he failed, yet again, to get into it (instead, Smoleevskiy, a military physician and who says he still sometimes misses his time in the simulator, read a medical textbook cover to cover). The Chinese astronaut trainer Wang Yue (dubbed “Vanya” by his Russian colleagues) practiced calligraphy. Each man tried to learn a colleague’s language, with varying degrees of success; in addition to playing video games, favorite pastimes included describing, in great detail, each country’s most delicious foods.
