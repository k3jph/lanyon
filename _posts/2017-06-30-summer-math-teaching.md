Trying to post more of my mathematics syllabi online, I have two
sections of [MATH
107](http://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/course-information.cfm?course=math107)
this term at [UMUC](http://www.umuc.edu/).  They are offset by like
three weeks, which makes life more complicated than I feel like it
should.  I keep asking myself, wait, which class is this?  Anyway,
I have [posted both syllabi](/teaching).

This fall, I have undergraduate statistics and [finite
mathematics](/2014/07/17/teaching-finite-mathematics/).
