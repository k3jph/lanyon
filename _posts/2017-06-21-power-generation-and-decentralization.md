Renewable energy gets more interesting if we can push those solar,
wind, and other renewable generation to the point of consumption.
For instance, I could have a small windmill and solar panels at my
house. This would decentralize production, decreasing risk overall.
This is an important point.

There are two huge risks associated with our current energy
infrastructure that decentralization can mitigate. First, there's
a huge risk associated with centralized power generation in that
those plants becomes single points of failure.
[Fukushima](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/fukushima) is an
important example of this. Japan saw an almost immediate pickup in
fossil fuel consumption following the accident in 2011. And this
was the start of a [long term change](https://lercpa.org/lng-japan/),
not even including immediate energy production demand as Fukushima
failed.

In addition, there's is a substantial perceived cybersecurity risk
associated with the current power system. For instance, the 2003
Northeast Blackout [was blamed on
hackers](https://www.ft.com/content/5bc0b16a-d8b8-11df-8430-00144feabdc0),
though that is [highly unlikely to be
true](/2010/10/18/irresponsible-fearmongering/). But
again, decentralizing production would mitigate a lot of that risk,
by making the entire system more resilient and multiplying both
routes and failure points.

If you think this looks like the Internet, there is good reason for
this.  The Internet was built to "[route around
damage](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/does-the-internet-route-around-damage)"
and the electrical system could too.
