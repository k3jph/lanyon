I was unable to capture the audio from my talk, but last Friday, I
spoke at the [2019 Joint Mathematics
Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) on the Mathematics
in the Realm of Cyber Research research track. There, I spoke about
an application of blockchain we had here for using blockchain to
supplement the [domain name
service](http://www.networksolutions.com/support/what-is-a-domain-name-server-dns-and-how-does-it-work/)
system. You can see my slides below:

All holders of the database possess the entire database and can verify it by verifying the historical cryptographic hashes.</p></blockquote>
