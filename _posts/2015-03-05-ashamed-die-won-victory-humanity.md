[Sweet Briar College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Briar_College) has announced it is closing after more than 100 years of operation.  This isn't a big deal and colleges have closed before.  Predictably, the higher education industry is [panicky](http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Sweet-Briar-s-Closure-a/228123/) over [what this might mean](http://suburbdad.blogspot.com/2015/03/gradually-and-then-all-at-once.html) for small liberal arts colleges across the United States.  I went to an [RU/VH](http://www.umd.edu) so I admit I am part of the problem.

But the real problem here is that nobody got the warning when [Antioch](http://antiochcollege.org/) closed the undergraduate college in 2008.  After a battle with the trustees, an alumni group bought the plant and restarted the institution, separately from the rest of the [Antioch University](http://www.antioch.edu/).  Because of the eventual reopening, the warning wasn't heeded before.  Smaller colleges will need to adapt and change to stay relevant and, therefore, open.  I don't know what changes will be necessary.  Some colleges will try one thing and others another.  There will be a lot of combinations in fits and starts.  Some will win and some will lose.  And that's fine.

As an aside, it's not unreasonable to suggest there will be a similar attempt to save Sweet Briar by alumni, students, or other interested parties.  If that happens, the warning will be lost again until next time.
