I've written a couple of posts about protecting the Chesapeake Bay.
Actually, I have written a lot of them.  But one I have not covered
is the Bay Restoration Fund, and it is an integral part of the Bay's
protection regime.  Let's look at why.

The [Chesapeake Bay Restoration
Fund](http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/BayRestorationFund/Pages/index.aspx)
is designed to reduce [nutrient
loading](https://enviroliteracy.org/ecosystems/drivers-of-biodiversity-loss/nutrient-loading/)
in the Chesapeake Bay caused by wastewater.  Like most places, we
process wastewater from homes and, [after some
cleaning](/2017/07/03/notes-wastewater-treatment/), the water gets
dumped into a nearby water source.  Usually, a stream or river
because it will carry away the water.  The wastewater cleaning
process is good for removing toxic chemicals and solids in the
water, but the process is not good at removing phosphorous or
nitrogen.  This lands in the Bay and will lead to
[eutrophication](/2017/07/10/eutrophication-reduction-local-limits/).

The Fund's revenue source is a small user fee imposed on Maryland
households using wastewater treatment systems.   Currently, the fee
is five dollars per month.  The fee pays for upgrading wastewater
treatment facilities to reduce nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations
in effluent.  That way, when the effluent hits the Bay, as it
eventually will, the nutrient balance is kept close to normal.  This
will keep the Bay clear of harmful algae blooms, keeping everything
else in the Bay alive.  So we can enjoy crab this summer.

Of course, the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund became much derided
as "[The Flush
Tax](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/12/maryland-begins-taxing-residents-for-flushing.html)."
A lot of people felt like they shouldn't have to pay for what they
flush.  That's silly, but septic users were also forced to pay,
despite not contributing to wastewater going to treatment plants.
But they did contribute to the problem.  Many septic systems
infiltrate the wastewater directly into the ground, allowing both
the septic system's construction and the natural ground structure
to clean the water.  So septic users to contribute to nutrient
loading in the Chesapeake, just through a different path.  So septic
users' fees pay to upgrade septic systems or ground cover the reduces
nutrient loading.

The downside, like many environmental problems, is that taxpayers
object to paying the charge.  This can stem from a few different
sources.  One major reason is that the connection between the fee
and what it does is never really made in the taxpayer's mind.
Another problem is that some people do not understand why it is
"suddenly" a problem.  Of course, it has always been a problem,
it's just that we didn't understand it or didn't have the tools to
fix it before.  Finally, some taxpayers don't appreciate the fact
some policies have long-term effects and implications.

The best part, however, is that now 13 years after the Flush Tax
was enacted, we now have evidence that is working.  WJZ did a story
about two weeks ago calling it "money well spent" as the results
are clear:
