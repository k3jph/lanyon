On Thursday, I had the joy of speaking at [Ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) again, this time at [Ignite Baltimore #18](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/).  I spoke about stormwater management and how we need to fix the stormwater management fee in Maryland to properly care for the bay.  It's a topic I've [discussed here before](https://jameshoward.us/2016/01/21/circling-the-drain/).  The talk is now available online.  It's only five minutes, so take a watch!

The Ignite format, 20 slides, autoadvancing every 15 seconds, is quite challenging and it was a lot of fun to do it again.  You can check out more of Ignite Baltimore's speakers over the last few years on YouTube:
