Several months back, Chase and I were at a [Pokémon
TCG](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/) prerelease.  I do not
recall which prerelease it was, but it was at [Alternate
Worlds](https://alternateworlds.popshop.comixology.com/) way out
in Cockeysville.    While there, Chase saw a Star Wars book and
asked me about it.  See, the only thing he loves more than Pokémon
is Star Wars.  And this had his attention.  It was a book from the
[Fantasy Flight Games _Star Wars
Roleplaying_](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire/)
game series.

So, growing up, I always heard that roleplaying games, i.e., _Dungeons
and Dragons_, were, well, [you know what it's like in the
Midwest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6AOd6r6Qi8).  Obviously,
I got better, but I never played anyway.  So this wasn't my bag at
all.  But I did know who to ask.  I posed the question to someone
Nina went to school with who gave me some solid suggestions and
good ideas on first, learning myself, and second, working with the
kids.

The bad news is that it has only been hit-or-miss with Chase.  I
am hoping the simpler basis for the _Star Wars_ game from West End
Games, [being reprinted this
month](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-the-roleplaying-game-30th-anniversary-edition/),
may make it a lot simpler.  The Fantasy Flight Game is just way too
complicated for an eight-year-old.

Now, Ducky, on the other hand, has jumped right in.  I had a couple
of good suggestions from Facebook, including _[Little
Wizards](https://www.crafty-games.com/shop/little-wizards/)_ and
_[No Thank You, Evil](http://www.nothankyouevil.com/)_.  We tried
_Little Wizards_ and she liked it, but it didn't really capture her
imagination.  But _[My Little Pony: Tails of
Equestria](http://riverhorse.eu/our-games/my-little-pony-tails-of-equestria/)_
was right up her alley.  Already well-versed in the Ponyverse, she
was quite happy with this.  I am, perhaps regretfully, not a
[Brony](https://whatisabrony.com/), but Ducky has been quite patient
in teaching me what I need to know.

This all leads to a problem we had.  See, we've been playing and
using various things on a hand-drawn map to represent our ponies.
I decided this wouldn't do.  Now, I could have purchased some My
Little Pony figures and been done with it.  But, you see, our ponies
were the ones Ducky and I created.  (Since, I know you want to know,
mine is a blue Pegasus named Thundercolt.  His cutie mark is a [π
(pi)](/2017/01/07/mathematician-different-kind-mathematician-statistician/).)

So I got on Amazon and found some [Shrinky
Dinks](https://www.amazon.com/Shrinky-Dinks-Creative-Sheets-Crystal/dp/B0103B04RO/).
These are plain clear sheets with no image on them.  I overlayed
them on top of some line-art provided with the _Tails of Equestria_
and traced out images for both a
[Unicorn](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorns) and a
[Pegasus](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Pegasus_ponies) pony.

After coloring these guys in with colored Sharpies, I cut them down
to circles and we tossed them in the oven for three minutes.  The
blue dots on the sides are bits of sticky tack I used for holding
the plastic sheets still while tracing the underlying image.  Also,
note, there's no mane or tail in those traced images.  I lifted
those from some line art I used when I created the original Thundercolt
ponysheet (visible in the cover image).

And look how amazing these turned out.

Ducky and I even got to use them for a session tonight!

Now, Chase has asked if he can make an
[X-wing](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X-wing_starfighter).
