Society's 2016 Convention.  Following up on the principles I outlined
in [my talk from last
year](/2015/09/14/planning-for-martian-polity-now-on-youtube/)
on governing future Martian colonies, this year I will be outlining
the complexity of funding public works projects on Mars.  Here's
my abstract, for the technically inclined:

> A mission to Mars, manned or unmanned, requires substantial
infrastructure in place to accomplish.  This infrastructure is
composed of communications, flight, and other components necessary
to support a mission.  A permanent outpost on Mars, or the Moon,
also requires infrastructure for communications, water, power, and
other things we consider public utilities on Earth.  Financing such
infrastructure is complicated, and additional costs and challenges
mount in hostile environments.  This talk will explore the economic
models used for financing infrastructure development and how those
models would apply on Mars.

[The convention will be September 22-25 at Catholic University of
America](http://www.marssociety.org/home/news/?post=save-the-date-2016-mars-society-convention-in-washington-dc),
in Washington, DC.
