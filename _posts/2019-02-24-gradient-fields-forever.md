The gradient of a scalar field is one of the most powerful topics
I've ever seen in mathematics. It is the, quite simply, the
multidimensional generalization of the derivative. We can interpret
it is a slope in more than one direction. For instance, in calculus,
we deal with two-dimensional lines that go back and forth in the
[latex]x[/latex]-plane and up and down in the [latex]y[/latex]-plane.

But imagine if, instead, we were standing on top of a hill. If it
is a nice hill that is basically a bump in a field, we can stand
on top and it goes down in every direction. There's a slope in every
direction and it is measured in two dimensions, how much it goes
up and down over a distance back-and-forth and how much it goes up
and down over a distance side-to-side. That's a nifty little measure
and with two distinct elements, is a vector that tells us how much
the height of the hill changes and in what direction.

These vectors can be vastly simplified into contour lines. We see
these contour lines in things like plat maps, engineering drawings,
and similar. Here's a neat example of [Rima Prinz
I](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4444) on the Moon, produced by [NASA
as a part of the Apollo 8
mission](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-362/ch1.htm).

There are other examples, too. If we take all of the individual
gradients and place them in the points where they exist, you get a
vector field. The vector field can show us in aggregate how everything
holds together. Here's another example of a vector field used to
show the evolution of [the May 24, 2017 tornado
outbreak](https://www.weather.gov/cae/may_24_2017_event_review.html) from
the National Weather Service.

This is just a small part of the great things we can do with scalar
fields and vector fields. It turns out, they are essential for
modern machine learning techniques, but that's a discussion for a
different day.
