In the late 1970s, statistician [George
Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box) created the
famous wisdom, "All models are wrong, but some are useful."  The
earliest version of the sentiment comes from Box's 1976 article,
"[Science and
Statistics](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1976.10480949)":

> Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct"
one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary, following William
of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural
phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models
is the signature of the great scientist so over-elaboration and
overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity.

While often used to explain that statistical, and especially
econometric, models are not designed to replicate reality, merely
help explain it.  And this is true, but it turns out the sentiment
extends well beyond statistics.

Models generally fall into one of two categories, prescriptive and
descriptive.  That sentence is itself a model describing models,
and that's more than a metanotation.  It is itself critical to
understanding models.

Descriptive models are those designed to explain reality, after the
fact.  Statistical models are one type, but so are the [electron
shell
model](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/chemistry--of-life/electron-shells-and-orbitals/a/the-periodic-table-electron-shells-and-orbitals-article)
of chemistry and Newton's gravitational model.  Notably, both are
wrong.  There are no electron shells and Newton's gravitational
model breaks down beyond certain speed thresholds.  Though these
models are wrong, they are useful.  They provide a simplified version
of their underlying systems that help understand the systems.  And
that's why they are useful.

Prescriptive models are a different beast.  They explain reality,
but before the fact.  I think the best example of a prescriptive
model is an architectural drawing.  Such a document does not, within
perfect precision, nor complete fidelity, explain how to build a
building.  There is still engineering, design, even basics such as
painting that happen before a building is done.  So it is wrong,
but it is still useful.  An architectural drawing is sufficient to
start a project.

As we teach model thinking, and its close cousin, systems thinking,
we need to be cognizant of reminding students that the model is not
the end, but only the beginning of thinking about a project.  It
helps you understand the underlying system but it is never the
system itself.
