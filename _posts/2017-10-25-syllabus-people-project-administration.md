Here's something interesting.  Despite having my work spread all
across multiple fields, which I kind of like, I rather want to make
sure I keep a connection to my home field.  The problem is, I can
no longer tell if that is mathematics or public policy.  So I teach.
Both.

And this spring, I will again be teaching for [Central Michigan
University](https://www.cmich.edu/)'s master of science in
administration program.  And this spring, I will be teaching something
different, [People and Project
Administration](https://www.cmich.edu/global/courses/pages/default.aspx?course=MSA647).
This is not a personnel administration course as one normally finds
in a public administration program.  Rather, this is on core project
management and relating that to people in the workforce.

You can read the [syllabus
here](/assets/docs/MSA647-Syllabus-Spring-2018.pdf) or on my [teaching
page](/teaching).  Or even better, register.  It will be at Joint
Base Andrews during January and February.
