Hurricanes are the topic of choice this year given Harvey's
record-breaking destruction of the Texas coast and the unusual
position of [three concurrent North Atlantic
hurricanes](http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/three_hurricanes_irma_jose_kat.html)
tracking as I write this. Given the circumstances, some are left
wondering why this year is unusual. Not since 2005 have we seen so
many powerful hurricanes. And even 2005, those were weaker compared
to this year and less frequent. Some of us point to the dangers of
climate change, [though that is apparently up for
debate](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/08/549280066/hurricanes-are-sweeping-the-atlantic-whats-the-role-of-climate-change).
In order to understand the role of climate change, it helps to
understand a bit of the physics of why hurricanes form.

Hurricanes form in the North Atlantic when hot and low-pressure air
come off the North African coast over the warm waters of the ocean.
The already warm water of the ocean more readily evaporates into
the atmosphere and condenses as it moves higher and cools. [Physics
Today](http://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.1.20170908a/full/)
ran an article describing this process as a Carnot engine, a type
engine that uses temperature differentials to provide mechanical
energy. In this case, the temperature differential is between the
warm water of the ocean and the evaporation-cooled air above it.
As the warm water evaporates, it gives more energy to the storm.

Around 20 years ago, an atmospheric scientist at MIT named Kerry
Emanuel used this model to figure out there was a [maximum potential
intensity for a tropical
storm](http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/pcmin/hurdes.html). That is,
it can only go so fast. That's a relief, [considering what I wrote
the other day](/2017/09/06/irma-not-category-6/).
But in 2009, [scientists investigated high-entropy air in tropical
cyclones' eyes](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008JAS2707.1).
Entropy is energy "lost" in the Carnot model described above. So
this is an air pocket of high entropy sitting in the eye of the
storm. It turns out that simulations of these pockets in storms can
cause tropical storms to blow passed the maximum potential intensity.
This source of this entropy is the [movement of warmer water off
the ocean
surface](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/daes/atmclasses/atm421/Reference_Material_files/PersingMontgomery_2003.pdf)
during the early stages of the hurricane.

This seems to be what happened with Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Irma
organized early off the western coast of Africa and as it marched
across the North Atlantic, the ocean kept powering it. Just like
the global air temperature anomaly, the [ocean is getting
warmer](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature),
too. And a warmer ocean, even just degree or so Celsius, makes a
big difference at scale, [like many other probabilistic
processes](/2015/10/27/probability-at-scale-and-kic-8462852/).
A degree warmer doesn't mean an extra day or two of shorts a year.
It means greater thermal differentials, the power source behind
hurricanes.
