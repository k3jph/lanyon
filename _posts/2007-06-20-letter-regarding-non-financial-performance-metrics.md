<a href="https://jameshoward.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/jh-2008-metrics.pdf"rel="">This letter</a> presents an overview of what priorities must be established when formulating non-financial performance metrics. The letter was sent to the Performance Oversight Committee of the [Columbia Association](http://www.columbiassociation.com) on June 1, 2007. It is a rehashing of the testimony presented to the Columbia Association's Planning and Strategy Committee on May 10, 2007.
