I found a pair of old presentations I gave when I was an undergrad.  At Maryland, I was in the [College Park Scholars Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/).  For [all the obvious reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcttcXcRYY), when it came time to select which scholars program I would take, I picked international studies.  The Scholars program required 18 credits, including a capstone, making it roughly equivalent to an academic minor, which UMD didn't have at the time.  Scholars was certainly the best part of my Maryland experience.  

I spent a lot of time in Scholars on [Cold War studies](http://www.coldwar.org).  It was 1998-2000, and ten years after after the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall) fell and the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union).  Cold War studies was hot.  [It probably should be again.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26116868)

I wrote my capstone on the [American invasion of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Russia_Intervention), which a lot of people still don't know happened.  I enjoyed the experience so much, I took the capstone course again in the spring of 2001.

The second time I took it, I was in a section focusing on the Cold War.  We heard a great presentation by Hugo Keesing on Cold War-themed music.  He had assembled a huge collection of Cold War-related songs, and I recall him playing "Atomic" by Blondie.  For reasons I have never been clear on, right around the same time, whenever you called Apple tech support, they would play "Atomic" on a loop on the hold music.  Keesing had a great story on NPR in 2010 on his Vietnam War-themed music archive.

Having been through it once and having just heard Keesing, I took a chance on the second project and studied the cartoons of _The New Yorker_ focusing on the Cold War.  The goal I had was to review _all_ of the cartoons in _The New Yorker_, highlight those that focused on Cold War themes (e.g., the military, the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons, and so forth).  

Like a good little nerd, I decided the Cold War started on August 6, 1945, and decided it ended on December 25, 1991.  Due to time constraints, I only reviewed up to the end of the Eisenhower Administration, January 20, 1961.  That still required reviewing more than a quarter of a million pages via microfiche and microfilm, which was probably crazy.  I did this via the library at the [University of Maryland](http://www.lib.umd.edu/).  But, also, because for some crazy reason, the Maryland library was closed the week of spring break, I also used the libraries at [Georgetown](http://www.library.georgetown.edu/) and [George Washington University](http://library.gwu.edu/).  

Anyway, I gave the presentation at [Undergraduate Research Day](http://www.ugresearch.umd.edu/ugresearchday.php) on April 25, 2001.  And it was awesome.  You can see the slides for "The Culture of Affluence Looks at the Cold War" here:

Of course, only like two people came.  But my professor, [Lois Vietri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lois-vietri-b562106), asked me if I'd give a presentation to the class.  Rather than give the same presentation, I actually rewrote it focusing instead on the cartoons that talked to the [Red Scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare) for May 3, 2001.  I called this presentation, "The Little Red Menace" and you can see it here:

"Jimmy Butler is a Communist" is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.  I am not entirely certain I gave the second presentation.  It stands out in my mind that I did not give this, but I no longer recall.

I also think it is worth reviewing these 15-year old PowerPoint presentations for insight into how bad a PowerPoint presentation can be.  We've come a long way, baby.
