On October 23, 1917, the State of Maryland organized a small group
of men (of course they were men) as the Maryland State Guard and
they had the responsibility for protecting Maryland while the United
States Army and Maryland National Guard were sent to Europe.  After
a few years, the Maryland State Guard was disbanded.  Then during
World War II, the state again organized a small group of me (of
course they were men) to be the [Maryland Minute
Men](/2015/12/15/volokh-conspiracy-maryland-state-guard/), again
protecting the state and resources while the Army and National Guard
were in Europe and Asia.  And a few years after the war, this group
was disbanded.

But again, in 1981, the state organized a small group of men and
women to be the [Maryland Defense Force](http://mddf.maryland.gov/)
(MDDF).  The MDDF is one of four components of the [Maryland Military
Department](http://military.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx).  The
other three are the Maryland National Guard, the Maryland Air
National Guard, and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency.  The
MDDF works side-by-side with these agencies, in uniform, to provide
support, additional staff, and relief for operations in-state.  And
[occasionally out of
state](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/brooke-gunning-the-maryland-defense-force-ready-when-called/article/56198).

Interestingly, the concept of the state defense force is explicitly
[encouraged by Congress](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32/109)
so that each state can have access to resources not subject to call
up for Federal service.  It does not relieve the individual members
from Federal service requirements, but the organization itself
cannot be called.  Something around half the states have active
defense forces and a few have dormant ones.

So today is the 100th anniversary of the MDDF, tracing its roots
back to the 1917 creation of the Maryland State Guard.  On Saturday,
the MDDF held a ceremony honoring that history, with a historical
presentation and speeches from Maryland's leadership.

I've been a member since 2006 and this summer was appointed the
Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Information Technology and
Communications.  Fortunately, we do not have business cards so I
will not have to figure out how to fit that on one.
