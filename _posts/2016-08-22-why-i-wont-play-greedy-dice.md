Chase and I have started playing the [Pokémon Trading Card
Game](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/), a lot. Perhaps
obviously, this comes from the confluence of two events.  First,
in July, [we started playing Pokémon
GO](https://jameshoward.us/2016/07/17/read-response-parents-need-know-pokemon-go/).
Second, he turned 7.  And 7 year-olds occasionally bring home random
Pokémon cards.  So we bought some.  A bunch, actually.

And the other day, I picked up a couple of packs of [Steam
Siege](http://xy11.pokemontcgxy.com/en-us/index.php), for us.  He
got two and I got two and we each pulled Greedy Dice:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0" data-card-type="article"><h4><a href="http://shop.tcgplayer.com/pokemon/xy-steam-siege/greedy-dice">Greedy Dice</a></h4><p>Our marketplace is open, support your local gaming stores.

He asked me if I was going to add it to my deck, and the answer is
no, and of course, he wants to know why.  Let's look at how you
play the card.  The text says,

> You can play this card only if you took it as a face-down Prize
card, before you put it into your hand.  Flip a coin. If heads,
take 1 more Prize card.

This doesn't help.  There's a 10 percent chance this card even ends
up as a face-down prize card.  And if it does, you have to pull it
randomly from the six prizes then win a coin flip to get another
prize.  After the 10 percent, I stopped trying to figure out the
probable benefit from this card.  It just isn't there.  You're
better off playing a copy of Town Map to give you (and, admittedly,
your opponent) some insight into your prize cards and allow for
more selective draws.

There's a counterargument that if Greedy Dice lands in your hand
via a draw, it still has use as discard fodder, for a card like
[Ultra Ball](http://shop.tcgplayer.com/pokemon/xy-fates-collide/ultra-ball).  But
in my experience (which is kind of limited), if I have to play Ultra
Ball, I usually am trainer rich in the hand, and have plenty of
other cards I can dump.  Or I can dump energy cards, knowing I can
pull them back later with
[Fisherman](http://shop.tcgplayer.com/pokemon/xy-breakthrough/fisherman).

So, yeah, Greedy Dice is a beautiful card, but it won't be seeing
any play, here.
