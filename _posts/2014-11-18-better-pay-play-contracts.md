The Cato Institute has a proposal on [incentive pay for
Congress](http://www.cato.org/publications/cato-online-forum/incentive-pay-congress).
The proposal includes a a base salary of $100,000/year coupled with
incentive bonuses for how well the economy has performed over some
period.  The proposal is fairly well laid out and addresses problems
with implementation, measurement, and so on.  But there's a large
and correctable flaw in the program.

The United States Federal Reserve System has a twin mandate:

1.  It has to minimize inflation, and
2.  It has to minimize unemployment.

These two goals are, ultimately,
[contradictory](https://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/our_dual_mandate.cfm).
A similar situation would work for better for the United States if
Congress had competing incentives.  The incentive change here is
that the base salary, instead of $100,000/year, should be the Federal
minimum wage.  This would place members of Congress on the same
playing field as the most vulnerable in society, but give them dual
incentives to provide income support and grow the economy.
