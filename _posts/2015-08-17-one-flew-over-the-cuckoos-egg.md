Over the weekend, I watched "The KGB, the Computer, and Me," a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/">NOVA</a> dramatization of <a href="http://www.kleinbottle.com/">Cliff Stoll's</a> experience chasing down a 75 cent accounting error.  I read the book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg">The Cuckoo's Egg</a>, back in the 90s, and it's a great book, though the cookies didn't turn out, when I made them.  NOVA dramatizes the events fairly well, though Stoll is an interesting narrator.

Someone put the NOVA episode on YouTube, so take an hour and watch it.
