My new book [Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with
R](/cmna) came out today from [Chapman & Hall/CRC
Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Computational-Methods-for-Numerical-Analysis-with-R/II/p/book/9781498723633).
This book is a long-standing project of mine--originally started
in 2001, and then using Octave as the base language.  As the world
didn't need yet another book on doing numerical analysis in Octave,
and therefore MATLAB, I eventually moved it to R.

_Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R_ is an overview
of traditional numerical analysis topics presented using R.  This
guide shows how common functions from linear algebra, interpolation,
numerical integration, optimization, and differential equations can
be implemented in pure R code. Every algorithm described is given
with a complete function implementation in R, along with examples
to demonstrate the function and its use.

_Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R_ is intended
for those who already know R, but are interested in learning more
about how the underlying algorithms work. As such, it is suitable
for statisticians, economists, and engineers, and others with a
computational and numerical background.

There's an associated package for R, called
[CMNA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cmna/index.html) and
the 1.0.0 release is available now.  This package includes working
implementations of all the methods discussed in _Computational
Methods for Numerical Analysis with R_.  For more information,
please see [Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with
R](/cmna).
