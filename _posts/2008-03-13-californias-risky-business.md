_James P. Howard II, "Letter to the editor," Los Angeles Times, March 13, 2008._

Following up on [yesterday's post](https://jameshoward.us/2008/03/12/government-bonds-arent-that-reliable/), the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com) runs this letter:

> Re "Hot and pricey," editorial, March 11

> The reality of state and municipal bond issues includes an unquantifiable element of political risk that private issues do not have. A general obligation bond is difficult to repudiate, but a political entity is subject to the whims of voters with regard to prioritizing financial concerns.

> This is especially true in California. If voters and their representatives were not likely to chase down every fad issue and project, a government with otherwise sound financials would possess a rating that reflects it. Private issues usually are not so flippant in their priorities.

> James P. Howard II
> Columbia, Md.
