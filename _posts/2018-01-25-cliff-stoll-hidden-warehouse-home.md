Okay, I will be honest.  I think Cliff Stoll is awesome.  I [posted
about him a couple of years
ago](/2015/08/17/one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-egg/) when I noticed
someone had posted his NOVA story on YouTube.  A couple of weeks
ago, at the [Joint Mathematics
Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_program_ss83.html),
I got to meet him, and that was awesome.  I even got a picture of
him playing with Baby, Ducky's stuffed baby-duck.  He is literally
full of energy in a way that I only wish I were.

He sells [Klein
bottles](https://plus.maths.org/content/introducing-klein-bottle)
through his website, [Acme Klein Bottle](http://www.kleinbottle.com/).
Klein bottles are these four-dimensional glass bottles that have
zero volume.  Or infinite volume, I suppose, [depending on which
side of the fence you are on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mGBaXPlri8).
Anyway, I bought a knitted Klein bottle hat and Möbius band scarf.
Oh, yes, also, a Klein bottle is the logical extension of a Möbius
band into four-space.  Anyway, he has a hidden warehouse in his
home full of thousands of glass Klein bottles and it is the craziest
thing I've seen in some time:

After you watch that, this will make so much more sense:
