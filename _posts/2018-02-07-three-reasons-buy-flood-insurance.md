[Holly Johnson of _The Simple Dollar_](three-reasons-buy-flood-insurance)
has an article on why should buy flood insurance:

{% include iframely.html url="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/three-reasons-everyone-should-consider-buying-flood-insurance/" %}

In this article, I tell the story of how [Hamilton, Ohio experienced
severe flooding only a month](/2016/06/02/femas-flood-maps-not-scam/)
after protests regarding the expanded Special Flood Hazard Area
increased the cost of flood insurance for many along a key corridor.

Also, I am not sure why, but Johnson says I am an insurance agent.
I am not; I am not here to sell anything but books.  And this is
from a month ago and I forgot to post it.
