<a href='https://twitter.com/opmdcstatus'>OPM DC Operating Status via Twitter</a><div class="link_description"><p>A few months ago, I created a <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to automatically announce the DC operating status maintained by the <a href="http://www.opm.gov">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM).  This status announces whether or not the Federal government is open or restricted during an emergency.  It is most often used to announce snow-related closings and some non-governmental employers rely on this for notifying their employees of weather-related emergencies..  This provides an advantage over other delivery methods provided by OPM in that Twitter can deliver selected user's tweets via a text message.</p>

<p>After testing for a few emergencies with (now) 15 followers, I am ready to announce <a href="https://twitter.com/opmdcstatus">@opmdcstatus</a> publicly.  If anyone at OPM wants to discuss making this more effective and efficient, please contact me.</p></div>
