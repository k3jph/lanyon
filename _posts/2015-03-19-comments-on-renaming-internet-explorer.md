Microsoft is [renaming Internet Explorer](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8230631/microsoft-is-killing-off-the-internet-explorer-brand).  From the article:

> Microsoft has tried, unsuccessfully, to shake off the negative image of Internet Explorer over the past several years with a series of amusing campaigns mocking Internet Explorer 6. The ads didn't improve the situation...

But the problem is not that Microsoft couldn't shake the negative image of IE over the last few years. It's that they couldn't shake the negative image going back to the 1990s. Users will forgive a bad release here and there. They don't forgive a bad product.
