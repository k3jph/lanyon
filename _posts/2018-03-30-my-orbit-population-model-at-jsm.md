I am happy to say my paper was accepted for the [2018 Joint Statistical
Meetings](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/) in Vancouver.
Actually, I think JSM accepts all papers.  That's not the point
right now.  This paper, "Forecasting Artificial Earth Satellite
Populations," builds several models for predicting how many satellites
will be in different orbit classes at different times.  Here's the
abstract:

> In this presentation, we will investigate four time-series models
for estimating the population of Earth-orbiting satellites.  Since
1957's launch of Sputnik 1, space access has grown steadily more
accessible as more nations and private actors have access to launch
capability.  Today, even a small team of high school students can
assemble and launch a space satellite on a reasonable budget.
>
> Servicing the orbiting hardware population includes launch,
tracking, and communications.  Understanding the demand for space
access is necessary for establishing the business case for providing
service, as well as future tracking of space debris and other
on-orbit risks.
>
> Using publicly available data from the Joint Force Space Component
Commander's Space-Track system, we construct four time-series models
for estimating the on-orbit population of four different orbit
classifications.  These models are used to predict populations for
ten year periods, going forward.

Obviously, such predictions are useful for modeling demand for
space-based services, which are capital-intensive and require a
substantial lead time to deliver.  I'll post the slides and preprint
when they are eventually completed.
