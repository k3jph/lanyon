This summer, I've been taking a class at [the Johns Hopkins
University](https://www.jhu.edu/) called [Nanotechnology and the
Environment: Applications and
Implications](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/575.763-nanotechnology-and-the-environment-applications-and-implications).
I had no idea what to expect when I signed up for this class.  When
I thought of nanotechnology, I thought of the
[Nanites](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nanite), nanoscopic
robots that took over the Enterprise on an episode of _Star Trek:
The Next Generation_.  I thought we'd study tiny robots and how
they can clean up the environment in some crazy future.

What I have learned is first much more nuanced and a lot more
complicated.  Nanotechnology is all around us and has been for
centuries.  The whole thing starts with the concept of the
[nanoparticle](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/nanoparticle.htm),
anything with a dimension less than 100 nanometers.  That's about
[a thousandth of the width of a human
hair](https://www.nanooze.org/how-big-is-a-nanometer/).  And they
are all over cosmetics.

The most interesting application is in sunscreen.  Sunscreen with
titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) [is relatively
common](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=titanium+dioxide+sunscreen).
The TiO<sub>2</sub> particles are engineered down to nanoscale and
mixed into the sunscreen.  These particles provide ultraviolet
protection, but have [been linked to some unusual
effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933802/),
such as damaged roofing tiles.  But we also do not know what happens
to these nanoparticles in the environment.  In the case of sunscreen,
we literally shed them in the water, on the beach, and on the
ballfields.  And we have no idea what that does.

Another interesting case of nanoparticles does date back centuries
and has to do with gold.  [Colloidial
gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold), a suspension
of gold particles, will range in color from red to blue depending
on the size of the particles.  Red gold nanoparticles were used as
early as the fourth century when the [Lycurgus
Cup](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=61219&partId=1&searchText=lycurgus+cup&page=1)
was stained red using colloidial gold.

Anyway, I was surprised by what I encountered so far in this class,
but quite excited by what I have seen so far.
