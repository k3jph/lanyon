For about two years, I've been working on a book called _Computational
Methods for Numerical Analysis with R_ (_CMNA_), which will present
an outline of numerical analysis topics with original (and simplified)
implementations in R at a level appropriate for a graduate student
or advanced undergraduate.  Last night, I sent the latest draft to
my editors, and I am quite pleased to say it should be heading into
production, soon.

The organizational structure of the text is based roughly on the
organizational structure of [MAPL
460](http://www-math.umd.edu/offered-courses/420-amsc-460-computational-methods.html)
15-20 years ago:


1. Introduction to Numerical Analysis
2. Error Analysis
3. Linear Equations
4. Interpolation and Extrapolation
5. Numerical Integration
6. Root Finding and Optimization
7. Differential Equations

I've wanted to write this book for a long time and I am happy to
say it will be published by [CRC
Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Computational-Methods-for-Numerical-Analysis-with-R/II/p/book/9781498723633)
in 2017 as part of their Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing
Series.  A lot of numerical analysis is taught using
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com).  I have a lot of respect for
MATLAB having used it for 15 years.  But there's room for other
options.  Fortran and C are not viable today, but R is readily
available for free.  And a lot of students are already picking it
up for statistics classes.

There are two other books, that I know of, that provide numerical
analysis in R.  Both are aimed at providing guidance on using the
existing implementations within R, also published by CRC Press:

* [Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and
Engineering](https://www.crcpress.com/Using-R-for-Numerical-Analysis-in-Science-and-Engineering/Bloomfield/p/book/9781439884485),
by Victor A. Bloomfield
* [Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R, Second
Edition](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Scientific-Programming-and-Simulation-Using-R-Second-Edition/Jones-Maillardet-Robinson/p/book/9781466569997),
by Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson

Both are excellent texts, but my book is different in that it will
provide the underlying algorithms and a variety of them for most
problems.   I will be posting additional details as they become
available.
