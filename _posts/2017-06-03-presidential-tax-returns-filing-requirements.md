One of the most irritating bits of the last election cycle has been
the focus on the President's tax returns.  [As we all
know](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/romney-and-the-tax-return-precedent/),
prior to the 1968 election, George Romney gave his tax returns for
12 years to a reporter and it has become something of a thing.
Trump was the first major candidate not to do something similar
since.  Since the campaign started, people have asked for Trump's
returns, especially since the election.

Most interestingly, [New Jersey's legislature passed a bill
requiring](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/christie_says_no_to_forcing_trump_others_to_releas.html)
candidates for President to publish their taxes before being allowed
on the ballot.  Governor Christie vetoed this.  Setting aside the
question of whether or not the public should have access to the tax
forms, I think Christie is legally right.

Article II of the Constitution lays out very specific requirements
for the Office of the President.  [I have been over those
before.](/2016/09/13/people-not-qualified-give-opinions/)  I do not
think states have the power to add substantive requirements to those
imposed by the Constitution.  It seems obvious from Article II and
the Supremacy Clause that the requirements are fixed and cannot be
amended by the states.  I think this argument is bolstered by the
reasoning in _[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v.
Thornton](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1456.ZO.html)_ which
held that states could not impose additional qualifications on
members of Congress.  In particular, Justice Stevens writes for the
majority:

> We are, however, firmly convinced that allowing the several States
to adopt term limits for congressional service would effect a
fundamental change in the constitutional framework. Any such change
must come not by legislation adopted either by Congress or by an
individual State, but rather--as have other important changes in
the electoral process--through the Amendment procedures set forth
in Article V. The Framers decided that the qualifications for service
in the Congress of the United States be fixed in the Constitution
and be uniform throughout the Nation.

That reasoning would almost certainly be mirrored in a challenge
to a law on additional filing requirements.
