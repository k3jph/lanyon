I am teaching intermediate algebra this spring and I wanted to post
the syllabus and give a bit of a comment here.  You can find the
syllabus on my [math education page](/teaching).

The course catalog gives a description:

> A study of problem-solving techniques in intermediate-level
algebra. The goal is to demonstrate number sense and estimation
skills; interpret mathematical ideas using appropriate terminology;
manipulate, evaluate, and simplify real-number and algebraic
expressions; and translate, solve, and interpret applied problems.
Emphasis is on numbers and algebraic properties, graphing skills,
and applications drawn from a variety of areas (such as finance,
science, and the physical world). Topics include polynomials;
factoring; exponents and their notation; rational expressions and
equations; rational exponents and radical expressions; linear,
quadratic, and other equations; and inequalities.

As we can see, this corresponds to what high school students normally
call [Algebra II](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/index-2.html).
Let that sink in.

day I will run out of generic free math pictures.  But that day is
not today._
