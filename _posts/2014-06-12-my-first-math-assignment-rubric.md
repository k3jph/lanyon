Grading can be a difficult proposition.  In a math course, the mechanics of a solution, meaning the correct addition and subtraction, may be correct.  However, a student may have misapplied a solution or not correctly understood the application of the mechanics to the problem in question.  As a result, it can be better to grade these different aspects differently.  In a writing course, this would be akin to grading spelling and grammar separately from organization of the argument.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)" title="Academic Rubrics on Wikipedia">Grading rubrics</a>, which outline the different facets of a solution and provide tiered assessments appropriate to the problem provide a solution to this for instructors.  Historically, I have given my undergraduate math students a 5-question quiz each week of class.  I grade these on a five-point scale (from 0 to 4) where 4 is a perfect solution, 3 is some small math (mechanical) error was seen, 2 is a good start, 1 is something somewhat relevant was written down, and 0 is nothing meaningful was stated.  This is a type of informal grading rubric.  It is also one-dimensional, which causes some issues.

As the <a href="http://www.umuc.edu/" title="University of Maryland University College">University of Maryland University College</a> converts from its custom WebTycho platform to <a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/" title="Desire2Learn">Desire2Learn</a>, I have noticed that formalized grading rubrics are baked into the platform and can be associated with each assessment.  Then, when grading, the rubric guides the process.  So I created my first formal rubric and attached it to this my quizzes.  This grading rubric essentially formalizes the informal grading rubric I had already used:

<ul>
<li>Detailed response given with no mathematical errors.</li>
<li>Detailed response given that shows understanding of the problem.  Final answer may not be correct.</li>
<li>Explanation or diagram unclear.  Final answer is not correct, but response shows some understanding of the problem.</li>
<li>Misses key points and no appropriate supporting diagram provided.  The response shows no understanding of the problem.</li>
<li>No answer given or response is not aligned to problem.</li>
</ul>

While formalizing the prior process is useful, it is self-evident this should be revised to reflect the multidimensional grading process used in college-level mathematics.
