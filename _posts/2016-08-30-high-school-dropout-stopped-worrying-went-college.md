Everyone has been posting their first day of school pictures this
week and I am reminded of a different first day of school.  Twenty
years ago, I took a dive into the deep end.  It was 
August 27th, 1996. And it was the day I dropped out of high school.

In May of 1996, I had completed the tenth grade.  Like all normal
and well-adjusted people, high school was an unnecessarily traumatic
experience.  And I'd had enough.  So I quit.  In August, I started
attending [Miami University](https://www.miamioh.edu/).  In Ohio,
there was a program called "Post-Secondary Educational Option," now
called [College Credit
Plus](https://www.ohiohighered.org/content/college_credit_plus_info_students_families).
The program is a dual-enrollment program, allowing students to
enroll at a college or university, for dual credit at both the
university and high school.  Typically, a student takes a higher
math or English class, possibly in the evening, along with at mostly
usual high school schedule.

But I didn't roll that way.  I took all of my courses at Miami.
Math, English, computer science, physics, history, and so forth.
I had to make sure the courses met the high school's requirements
for graduation, but courses generally transferred over on a 1-to-1
basis. Of course, being on Miami's campus full time was a great
experience.  And I was, except for being 16, a regular student.  I
had an on-campus job in the computer labs and was later elected
president of the CompuClub, which is a whole other story.    I was
there for two years, and took all of my courses over the 1996-97
and 1997-98 academic years at Miami's Hamilton campus, except for
one at the Middletown campus.  I never took another class at the
high school again, and only rarely even visited.

Technically, I didn't really drop out, I suppose.  But, indeed, I
think I did.  In June of 1998, I graduated from high school, despite
dropping out, and the following fall I started at the [University
of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu), with 57 semester
hours complete.  Not bad for a freshman.

Dual enrollment programs cause a fair bit of concern for college
administrators.  Matt Reed, vice president for for learning Brookdale
Community College [has written on this topic many
times](http://suburbdad.blogspot.com/).  Having non-adult students
on campus can cause some headaches, and managing transfers back to
the high school is also a problem.  But this program in Ohio gave
my higher education an excellent start. I don't think I've ever had
a dual-enrollment student in one of my classes.  But if I do, I
would wish them well.  It's a challenge and one worth undertaking.
