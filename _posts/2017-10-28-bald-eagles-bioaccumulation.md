America's favorite symbol is the glorious bald eagle.  The bald
eagle lives across the country and is endangered.  This story goes
back to 1962 and the publication of [Rachel Carson's _Silent
Spring_](http://www.rachelcarson.org/SilentSpring.aspx), which
detailed the effects of pesticides.  In particular, Carson focused
on DDT, widely used to [combat disease-carrying
insects](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status).
And despite low background levels of DDT in the environment, high
concentrations were found [in dead
eagles](http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle11.html) and it was
[thinning their
eggshells](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/recovery/biologue.html), too.
These thin eggshells often broke during incubation, killing the
eaglet and drastically cutting the population.

But eagles are not particularly susceptible to DDT poisoning.  What
happened was much more insidious.  When DDT entered water reserves,
commonly by spraying for insects, the DDT did not immediately
disappear.  Some small amount would be consumed by a small fish.
And some small amount would be consumed by a larger fish.  Some
small amount would be consumed by all of these fish, and they DDT
deposits would stay within the fish, typically in the fishes' body
fat.  I actually [discussed this a couple of weeks
ago](/2017/10/07/wont-someone-please-think-sushi); the process is
called [bioaccumulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1426146).
Formally, it is the result when an organism absorbs more of a
substance than it can process and remove as waste.

But it's a food chain.  The larger fish eat the smaller ones.  The
larger ones end up not just the with the DDT they bioaccumulated,
but also whatever the smaller fish had since it ate that fish.  The
fish at the top of the food chain are the biggest and build up the
most DDT or another toxin.  It's like a [reverse pyramid
scheme](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pyramidscheme.asp) and
it is called
[biomagnification](http://www.biology-pages.info/D/DDTandTrophicLevels.html).
Those fish at the top of the water-based chain, like salmon, happen
to be the favorite fish of the eagles.

So by the time the eagle gets around to dinner, its food is highly
contaminated and it absorbs a much higher amount of DDT than it
would get from the environment alone.  Because of this, the eagles'
contamination was much higher than expected and it led to severe
effects for the eagles including a drastic reduction in population.

Like many of these stories, there is some good news.  The bald eagle
is a charismatic creature and our national symbol and the government
moved quickly to [prevent DDT
use](http://www.panna.org/resources/ddt-story).  Due to these
actions, and many others by the Environmental Protection Agency and
states, the bald eagle population has [substantially
recovered](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bald-eagles-soaring-back-to-recovery-after-almost-going-extinct-in-the-1960s/).
