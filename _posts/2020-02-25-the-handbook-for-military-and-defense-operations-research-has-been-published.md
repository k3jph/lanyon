I am very happy to announce that the _Handbook for Military and
Defense Operations Research_, coedited with [Natalie
Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com/), has been published by CRC
Press. The electronic copy is [available
now](https://www.crcpress.com/Handbook-of-Military-and-Defense-Operations-Research/Scala-II/p/book/9781138607330)
and the print copy will be [on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1138607339) on March 2!
It was a lot of fun to work with Natalie on this, and we jointly
chaired several sessions at last fall's [INFORMS conference in
Seattle](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2019/)
dedicated to the topics covered here.

From the back of the book:

> Operations research (OR) is a core discipline in military and
defense management. Coming to the forefront initially during World
War II, OR provided critical contributions to logistics, supply
chains, and strategic simulation, while enabling superior decision-making
for Allied forces. OR has grown to include analytics and many
applications, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and
big data, and is the cornerstone of management science in manufacturing,
marketing, telecommunications, and many other fields. 

> The Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research presents the
voices leading OR and analytics to new heights in security through
research, practical applications, case studies, and lessons learned
in the field.
