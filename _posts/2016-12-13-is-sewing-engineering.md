Last night, Nina spent some time working on a holiday dress for
Ducky.  There will be another post about this next week, but Nina
hit me with a question,

> How is this not engineering?

And I responded, "It is."  But that's only half the story.  As I
post on a lot of different subjects, I usually like to make sure
at least one of the tags for each post is a top-level subject and
for a list, I like to use Wikipedia [Outline of Academic
Disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines).[1.
As an aside, someone "cleaned up" the article recently, and it is
not as good as it used to be.  The best revision before that seems
to be [this
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outline_of_academic_disciplines&oldid=741325045).]
So I figured that sewing would somehow or another fall under materials
science or mechanical engineering.  I bring all this up because it
highlights an important point.  Wikipedia generally reflects concensus
views, and is descriptive rather than prescriptive.  I often say,
"Wikipedia is the average of all human knowledge."

That descriptive approach places
[sewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing) under [textile
arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_arts), which seems okay,
but that falls under "art media" and "decorative arts" and that's
not engineering.  Wikipedia's consensus descriptivism is that sewing
is an artistic discipline, and not an engineering discipline.  While
the conclusion is incorrect, it does represent the consensus, and
that's a problem.  A brief Googling leads to more information.

Sewing, leatherworking, metalworking, and other low-technology
crafts are generally placed a tier or more below the high-technology
engineering.  But these low-tech skills are important disciplines
in their own right, and they are necessary when working on high-tech
projects.  For instances, the Picavet I built with Chase last weekend
for floating a camera is built from a picture frame, dowel rod,
paracord, and some rings.

There's nothing high-tech about it but it will be absolutely critical
for our high tech project.  And this is not a one-off.  In an essay
last year, [Stephanie E. Vasko
writes](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/06/stem_classes_should_include_lessons_about_low_tech_crafts_like_sewing.html):

> Increasingly, sewers can integrate high-tech materials and
components into garments, regardless of location and education
level. Iâ€™m not just talking about sewing machines; new supplies
like conductive thread, sewable circuits, and programmable LEDs
have become easily accessible...

Dr. Vasko further notes that crafts can be a gateway to higher
technology projects.  I saw this last night as Chase ran a basting
stitch for the dress.  But it's also not a one off.  [Nita Patel
writes how traditional home-based crafts led her to electrical
engineering](https://www.ecnmag.com/blog/2016/04/i-became-engineer-because-sewing-machine):

> We started with hand sewing and graduated to using my mom's sewing
machine.  > > It was electric when I got to use the machine. Wow!
A device that could reduce the time it took to make a skirt from
about a week -- after you already messed up and started over about
five times -- to an hour. The concept that an electric machine that
could simplify my arts and craft workload was wonderful.

Part of the problem, also noted by Dr Vasko is that crafts and
technology have been gendered, and we can see that in these two
reports.  But that's not necessarily so.  I may have [stapled my
sleeve this morning](https://www.instagram.com/p/BN6xDf_lboH/), but
that's for lack of a sewing kit, not know-how.  Teaching these sorts
of basic crafting skills is really something we should be teaching
as part of the core STEM/STEAM curriculum.  Especially because they
provide critical thinking skills necessary to support later engineering
and design development.
