Well, we all know I am not one to let an opportunity for self-promotion
to slide.  So it is strange that I didn't announce this already. 
But last night, I was asked to fill in on a panel called "Identity
and Trust" at the [2nd Interoperability
Forum](https://www.healthit.gov/news/events/oncs-2nd-interoperability-forum)
sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services's [Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology](https://www.healthit.gov/)

One of the dominant forces right now in both healthcare and identity
management is blockchain. And I have a bit of experience working
with blockchain based solutions and many of these are overhyped. I
actually alluded to this briefly in [a recent
column](https://jameshoward.us/2018/02/19/data-science-overhype/). But
in the case of identity management, I keep hearing echoes of previous
stories.

The only important thing I said was a reminder to everyone of [Greenspun's
Tenth Rule](http://philip.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000tgU):

> Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an
ad-hoc, informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half
of Common Lisp. <cite>Philip Greenspun, c.1993.</cite>

I've modified this for identity management:

> Any identity management system contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified
bug-ridden slow implementation of half of
[OpenPGP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt).

Keep that in mind when you hype self-sovereign identity like it's
you invented it.
