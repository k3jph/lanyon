The Graduate School at the <a href="http://www.umbc.edu">University of Maryland Baltimore County</a> provides a <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/graduateschool/etd/latex.html">dissertation template</a> for graduate students.  This template is incomplete and the formatting does not meet the specifications the graduate school puts out.  While writing my dissertation, I developed my own style files and template that does meet the Graduate School's requirements.  I have made this available:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/howardjp/umbcthesis">GitHub repository</a>, with Gitflow</li>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/b/IL0oRlIz/umbc-thesis-style">Public Trello board</a></li>
</ul>

Please use them at UMBC and adapt them to your university as you see fit!
