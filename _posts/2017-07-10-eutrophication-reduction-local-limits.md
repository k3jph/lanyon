Both the Baltic Sea and the Chesapeake Bay are great examples of
complex and diverse watersheds. The Baltic Sea is quite large and
has a catchment area of [1,641,650 square
kilometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea) over nine or
ten countries. The Chesapeake Bay is smaller about a tenth the size,
but [166,534 square
kilometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay) over seven
states. We can see them both here.

Both the Baltic Sea and the Chesapeake Bay are afflicted by
eutrophication, a strange kind of dead zone in the water. Eutrophication
is caused by an overabundance of phosphates and nitrogen in the
water. Small amounts are healthy in the water, allowing plants and
algae to grow steadily. However, runoff from farmland, usually rich
in fertilizer, drastically increases the phosphate and nitrogen
downstream.

Basically fertilizing the water, algae grows unchecked killing
almost everything else. We call these algae blooms, like the one
seen in the picture above. In addition to creating dead zones in
the water, eutrophic waters can harm people. They may be unsafe for
swimming or other recreation and might harm sources of potable
water. We saw this with [Toledo and a red algae bloom in Lake
Erie](http://www.motherjones.com/food/2015/08/giant-toxic-algae-bloom-haunts-toledo/)
in 2005. So limiting eutrophy in major bodies of water is critical
for safety.

Under current conditions, the nutrients build up all along the
watershed until they dump into the central body of water. There,
they peak and have the worst effects. Tributary-based total maximum
daily load (TMDL) limits can be a balanced solution to the problem.
Using such a TMDL limit, business and agriculture all along the
watershed path would be able to use nutrient-generating fertilizers.
However, there would be limits all along the path.

The TMDL recognizes that each of these chemicals will eventually
fall out of the water supply. Some mix with other chemicals and
become inert. Some are consumed along the way. With this in mind,
there's a sort of "half-life" that allows us to predict how much
of a chemical will remain after certain periods. If the TMDL limits
are properly structured around the half-lives, as each tributary
flows into the next body of water, the impact at the headwater is
minimized.

The downside to such an approach is that it requires substantial
cooperation among different parties across the watershed. With a
single unified government, such as the EPA, this is feasible in the
United States. However, the watershed supporting the Baltic Sea is
not governed, at any level, by a single body. The European Union
covers much of the watershed, but Russia and Belarus are not subject
to EU regulation. With this in mind, separate agreements need to
be negotiated. While possible, it does increase the complexity of
a TMDL-based solution to Baltic Sea management.
