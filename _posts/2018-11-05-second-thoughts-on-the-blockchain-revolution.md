I am in Phoenix right now and yesterday I gave my talk here at
[INFORMS](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2018/).  I
was invited to talk about blockchain by [Natalie
Scala](http://drnataliescala.com/) and the presentation went well.
Unfortunately, my attempt to capture audio crashed and burned, but
here's all you need to know:

1.  Blockchain is not the answer.
2.  No, you're not the exception.
3.  If you were, I would have called you already.
4.  Go back to step 1.

Check out the slides below!
