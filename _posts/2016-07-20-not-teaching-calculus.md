Well, no sooner had I posted my note about teaching calculus again
this fall when UMUC changed my schedule.  This is not unusual for
me (though I may be unusual in this regard at UMUC, it's a bit
unclear).  I occasionally end up getting put in other classes than
planned at the last minute.  Part of this stems from the fact [I
have taught almost the entire undergraduate mathematics
curriculum](/teaching), and part of it is I just don't
mind the challenge of something good new.

This fall, I will be teaching MATH 115 Precalculus. I have taught
precalc several times as well as its underlying components, college
algebra and trigonometry.  So this will be fun.  I've never really
taken the time to blog out an entire undergraduate mathematics
course.  I will try to do that with precalc this fall.
