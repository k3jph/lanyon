[Andrew Gelman is right that potential Scottish
independence](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/06/27/brexit-vs-texit/) comes
at a cost of losing influence in the larger United Kingdom (UK).
However, the political calculus is not quite as Gelman describes.
Look at it this way.  The UK has lost some influence in European
political structures.  First, the [European
Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en/) (EC) is
essentially a do-nothing body that nobody cares for.  So losing
influence there is no big deal.  However, the British have also
lost influence in the [European
Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm), where it is represented
by an appointee of HM Government.  And that's a loss.

The counter balance to this is not the gain in self-rule, as Gelman
describes, but rather leaving the sphere of influence of the EC.
As it will no longer be a member of the European Union (EU), it
will no longer be subject to its rules and regulations.  (This sets
aside the fact the EU will exact punishing tribute on the British
in order to get a trade deal, and, frankly, the British will likely
end up _more_ integrated with Europe than it is now, but that's a
detail of the current political structure.)

In Gelman's calculation, if Scotland leaves the UK, Texas leaves
the United States, or Québec leaves Canada, the downside is that
the UK, US, and/or Canada will move in the opposite direction
politically as a sort of "conservation of momentum" and the cost is
that each unit will lose influence over the whole.  I agree with
that, but the real counter balance is the lost influence of the
whole over the subunit, which is what the radical secessionists in
each of these jurisdictions want.
