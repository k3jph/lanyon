One of the most well-known aspects of Confucian thought is the
importance of the social order. Confucius thought it was important
that everyone know their place in society. This idea is summarized
by Confucius:

> Let a prince be a prince, and ministers be ministers; let fathers
be fathers, and sons be sons.<cite>--Confucius, _Analects XII_</cite>

But it means so much more. This is an extension of the filial piety
idea, and shows that everyone's place is both defined and _ordered_.
That is, sons are beholden to fathers, wives to husbands, but also
subjects to their king. This matters because if adopted as widespread
though, leads to extreme social stability. This is one of the reasons
by China has been remarkably stable for more than 2500 years.

Of course, the reason we study history is to help us understand the
future. Right now, the world is event that can potentially upend
the social order, globally. [COVID-19 has exposed gaping
holes](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-social-distancing-and-self-quarantine)
in political, economic, and social systems, globally. That's
interesting, but what's more important is how people respond to
those holes. Extreme social stability, such as that proposed by
Confucius may mean little changes in societies influences by Confucian
thought. On the other hand, nations like the United States and
France ground their [founding
myths](https://jameshoward.us/2020/03/22/china-and-founding-myth/) on
the importance of revolutionary change. What changes and what does
not will tell us a lot about how people think.
