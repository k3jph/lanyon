[Del. Terri
Hill](https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/06hse/html/msa17057.html) has
recently proposed legislation that would give the Howard County
Council the ability to impose a nominal tax on disposable bags.
The _Sun_ did a write up on it:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0" data-card-type="article-full"><h4><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/ph-ho-cf-bag-tax-1122-story.html">Proposal would allow Howard County to impose a plastic bag tax</a></h4><p>Democrat Terri Hill plans to introduce a bill that would allow Howard County to levy a tax on disposable bags. The law exists in Washington, D.C. and Montgomery county. Baltimore City, Prince Georges county and the state legislature have failed to pass their own initiatives.</p></blockquote>

Predictably, this has rankled some people.  The most vocal opposition,
right now, is coming from [Scott
Ewart](https://scotteblog.com/2018/11/14/public-notice-for-hearing-on-local-bills-agenda-and-proposed-bills-update/).
Reading Ewart's blog post is a good sketch of the reasons people
will be opposed and all of the reasons, of course, collapse under
any level of scrutiny.

Using a small tax is the correct way to achieve the policy objective
of reducing plastic bag use.  First, straight bans tend to result
in stunted workarounds.  [In some jurisdictions, big retailers just
switched to a different disposable bag that didn't violate the
law.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-carryout-bag-fees-are-better-than-plastic-bag-bans_us_588187ace4b08f5134b61f79)
Second, compared to bonuses for reusing bags, the [tax is more
effective](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/case-plastic-bag-tax-why-dont-we-all-carry-weight)
in altering behavior.  Third, there's a substantial cost associated
with plastic bags, regardless of their final disposition. Into the
environment, [they are a risk to wildlife and freshwater
sources](https://www.citizenscampaign.org/campaigns/plastic-bags.asp). Into
the MSW stream, they [take up landfill
space](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/01/31/what-happens-to-all-that-plastic/).

The trick is in what happens to the money.  If the tax is collected
specifically to pay for the costs associated with the bags, then
the tax is absolutely the right thing to do. If the tax is collected
and dumped into the General Fund, then this is just a cash grab.

The bill is not currently in [MLIS](http://mlis.state.md.us/), but
this just appears to be an enabling legislation that allows the
County to set its own tax if the Council and Executive determine
that it is appropriate.  We will have a clearer picture of the
proposal when the text is filed.
