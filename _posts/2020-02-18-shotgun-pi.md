Monte Carlo is a beautiful process that can be used to address many,
many problems. One of my favorites is that it can be used to estimate
the value of [latex]\pi[/latex]. First of all, we know that
[latex]\pi[/latex] is the ratio between the radius of a circle,
squared, and its area. We can use that to Monte Carlo to estimate
this ratio.

If you are not familiar with the [Open Science
Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/) (OSG), it is a large high-throughput
computer available as a national user facility. Unlike some other
supercomputer facilities, the OSG is not intended for tightly-coupled
jobs. And calculating [latex]\pi[/latex] via Monte Carlo is a very
loosely-coupled job. In fact, one of the [samples for using the OSG
in
R](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000674219-calcuating-pi-using-r)
is exactly this.

About a year ago, I redid the sample using the newish programming
language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust is getting a lot
of press as a new systems programming language and a lot of its
[memory
safety](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html)
features. I think this makes it a good candidate for numerical
programming. So I ported the R example over to Rust, which required
a bit of work, but was doable. You can see the result here:

It's got all the things I want in a programming language, that I normally get from C, and also gives me some measure of protection against really screwing up. Not that I do that much...or even have a use for, anymore.</p></blockquote>

Of course, there's nothing quite like a physical analog, and this
physicist decided to use a shotgun to replicate the Monte Carlo
approach!

Do not try this at home.
