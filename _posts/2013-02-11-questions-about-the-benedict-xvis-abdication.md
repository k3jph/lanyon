So I have some interesting political and social questions, that might be a bit different from anything I've heard so far:

1. Will Benedict XVI be permitted to take part in the Conclave?
2. How shall we address His Holiness after the abdication?
3. Will he still claim diplomatic immunity and will it be honored?
4. Of what country will he be a citizen?

This is a rare opportunity to see the international community respond to a new distinction in status.  It might be interesting.
