So there's good news and bad news here.  First, the [National Flood
Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program)
(NFIP) has been extended as part of Friday's budget deal:

The bad news here is that the program is still a mess.  The incentives
are all out of whack and the program continues to slowly drill a
small, but growing, hole in the Federal budget.

And I for one welcome our returning insurance overlords.  The program
is a necessity.  And fixing it in place is probably better for most
people that taking it out back and giving it the [Old
Yeller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xM5Pwio9Y).  Giving the
ongoing inaction on any substantive matter in the crippled Congress,
no replacement for the NFIP would be forthcoming.  But that also
means the program is unlikely to be fixed, too.
