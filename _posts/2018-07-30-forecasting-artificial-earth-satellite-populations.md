As [I wrote back in March](/2018/03/30/my-orbit-population-model-at-jsm/),
my orbit population prediction model is going to be presented at
the [Joint Statistical Meetings](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/)
in Vancouver, today. The point of this is to better understand how
space will be used between now and 2030. As more and more organizations
launch small satellites and satellite constellations, the demand
to service these devices with communications, launch, and other
infrastructure may outstrip supply. Predicting now what demand will
be will can help service providers better understand demand.

You can see a copy of my poster below. In a few weeks, I should have a
draft paper ready.
