This morning, #ChaseKBH and I are going down to the [18th Mars Society Convention](http://www.marssociety.org/conventions/18th-annual-international-mars-society-convention).  But back here on Earth, I have classes to prepare and problems to solve.  I have posted the [syllabus for PUAD 701 Public Administration and Public Finance](/teaching/public-economics).  

The course has two major distinguishing features.  First, I moved to an almost fully [flipped classroom](https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eli7081.pdf).  The flipped classroom has become a huge experimental success in high schools, but there's not a lot of talk about it in higher education.  In fact, I found almost no talk at the graduate level when I searched a few months ago.  But my classroom has been slowly flipping, anyway.  Over the last three terms, I've gone from pure lecture, to a minimal homework review, to a pretty strong focus on collective problem solving.  But it was the students driving those changes, not me.  I was just along for the ride.  So why not embrace it.  It will be interesting to see how this goes.

Second, we will have a class focus on how public finance and public administration intersect with the problem of Baltimore's food deserts.  There are a lot of places in the City without regular access to safe, healthy, and nutritious food, and this has a damaging effect on public health, welfare, and local stability.  The city is now running the [Baltimore Food Policy Initiative](http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Planning/BaltimoreFoodPolicyInitiative/FoodDeserts.aspx) to combat these issues.  The University of Baltimore has engaged in a campus-wide project to focus on these food deserts over the 2015-2016 academic year.  Classes will be working on projects in classes across the University to investigate and solve these problems.  It's exciting to be a part of that.
