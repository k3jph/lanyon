I was recently reminded of the movie _Lord of War_, when, two
prostitutes, Faith and Gloria, were sent to Nicolas Cage's character
by some warlord or another.  Anyway, Cage is gently refusing the
ladies' advances when the topic of HIV comes up:

> Faith: [speaking softly] You worry too much.
>
> Gloria: [speaking softly] Why would you worry about something
that can kill you in ten years where there are so many things that
can kill you today?

This second line is a brilliant example of how people think about
risk.  People will generally discount the future, sometimes by quite
a bit.  Sometimes this is rational.  Faith and Gloria live in a war
zone.  Why worry about the future when it might not be there?  This
line of thinking extends into the inner cities of the United States,
but it is also true for people who are smokers or inducing other
health hazards.

This is why people are more concerned about terrorism which is
highly unlikely to affect them than they are heart disease, which
will kill one out of every four Americans.  This idea of properly
measuring risk and understanding how to respond to it was part of
my discussion at [NerdNite
Baltimore](/2017/04/22/slides-nerdnite-baltimore-8/).  Unfortunately,
there's no good answer.
