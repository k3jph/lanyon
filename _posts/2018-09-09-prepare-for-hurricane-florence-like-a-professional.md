Right now, the Mid-Atlantic is staring down [Hurricane
Florence](https://weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2018-09-09-hurricane-florence-forecast-southeast-coast).
The best guess anyone has right now is that this will hit between
Florida and New York...but wherever it hits, it will be a very
powerful storm.  And powerful storms bring damage from floods to
downed power lines and collapsed buildings to broken gas pipes.
Knowing how to prepare yourself for disaster is the single best
thing you can do to prepare.

Modern disaster management moves beyond [hiding in the storm
cellar](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/27ba72c4-b4cd-431e-a28c-6d1f640753f7)
until the danger has passed.  A huge part is understanding exactly
what local authorities will be doing, along with proper preparation
on our own part.  FEMA offers 185 free online courses, some of them
eligible for college credit, on disaster response and management:

With 185 courses, it is obviously overwhelming to know even which
to take.  So here, take these two.  FEMA says they should take about
an hour each.  I think you can probably do it in less time.

* [Introduction to the Incident Command
System](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-100.c):
This course is for first responders, but really, everyone will
benefit from it.  It will give you a high-level overview of exactly
how the government will be responding, including structure,
communications, and management of critical incidents.  This is used
for, basically, **everything** first responders do today.  Whether
it is a multi-state disaster like a hurricane or a small house fire,
the ICS is the template for site management.
* [Community Preparedness: Implementing Simple Activities for
Everyone](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-909):
This class is an introduction of what you can do for your family,
business, or community to prepare for **any** disaster.  It cannot
and does not cover everything, but this is the course for everyone.

Going through both these courses will help you survive and recover
better from any disaster that might befall you.  Hurricane Florence
will hit in four days...take an hour between now and then to get
ready, wherever you are.
