I've been concerned for some time that we are deep in an overhype
cycle with data science.  It keeps appearing on [hottest job
lists](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregoryferenstein/2016/01/20/report-why-data-scientist-is-the-best-job-to-pursue-in-2016/)
and everyone seems to think data science can solve all their problems.

But technologists have seen this pattern before, especially with
intelligent tools.  And we need to be careful about making sure we
do not overpromise and we explain what the limits of data science
are.  It is, just, applied statistics.  So we have all those limits
on us.

I have an essay in the current issue of [Industrial
Management](http://industrialmanagement.epubxp.com/i/935826-jan-feb-2018),
the house journal of the [Institute of Industrial and Systems
Engineers](), discussing these limits and warning readers of when
they can hit them.

There doesn't seem to be an open copy of the essay online.  I will
post it if it pops up.  Since the printed copy just arrived in my
mailbox, I would think online is not far behind.
