This week in the [Coursera IoT Capstone Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-of-things-project/home/welcome), we had to complete a design document.  However, unlike a true design document, the requirements specified a list of options for potential design, along with evaluation and selection.  this makes it much closer to a design alternatives document.  Anyway, I have posted the design alternatives document to the [Carme Project page](https://jameshoward.us/projects/carme/).
