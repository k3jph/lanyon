So I am in a meeting recently, and someone says he needs a
mathematician.  A second person points at me and says, "He's not
just a mathematician.  He's a mathematician, a different kind of
mathematician, and a statistician."  Then I had to explain it.  See,
the phrase, on the top of this blog, on my Twitter bio, and many
other places, is also on the top of my resume.  And the second
person had interviewed me.  And he asked me about it.

It's not all that clever.  I stole it from an episode of _The
Simpsons_.[1.  Also, you should note "Simpsons Quotes" is a skill
listed on my LinkedIn profile.]  In season 5, in 1994, they aired
"Deep Space Homer."  This is, possibly, the most quoted episode of
the series.  It's the origin of the famous "I, for one, welcome our
new insect overlords" quote, which has since snowcloned into an
avalanche.  You can see that clip here:

But at the start of the episode, Homer and Bart are nearly forced
to watch "another boring space launch" when the batteries fall out
of the remote control.  In the lead up, this exchange happens, from
the broadcast:

> Announcer 1: Now let's look at the crew a little.
>
> Announcer 2:  They're a colorful bunch.  They've been dubbed the
three musketeers. [ chuckling ]
>
> Announcer 1: And we laugh legitimately. There's a mathematician,
a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.

You can see the clip here.
