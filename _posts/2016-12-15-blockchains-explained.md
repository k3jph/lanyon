I found a really neat demonstration of how
[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database))
works.  The video, created by Anders Brownworth, is on YouTube:

{% include youtube.html id="_160oMzblY8" %}

It provides a walkthrough that takes us from cryptographic hashing,
to blocks, to blockchains, to distributed blockchains, to distributed
ledgers.  It's the clearest discussion of blockchain's I've ever
seen.

Even better, the entire system can be played with [on Brownworth's
website](http://anders.com/blockchain/) and the source code is
available [via GitHub](https://github.com/anders94/blockchain-demo).
