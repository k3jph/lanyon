[This article from Friday's _Wall Street
Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-change-could-swamp-your-muni-bond-portfolio-1517613603)
caught might attention because of the link between municipal bonds
(an old hobby of mine) and climate change.  The gist of the article
is that some jurisdictions are playing down the risk of climate
change when they are borrowing from capital markets.  Of course,
if a city is likely to be flooded as sea levels rise, then there
is a risk to the tax base and it reduces the ability of a city to
pay off its bonds.

But at the same time, some cities are talking out both sides of
their both sides of their mouths on the issue.  This article points
out that California municipalities (San Francisco, San Mateo, and
Oakland are the examples) are pushing court cases describing the
risk as an imminent threat of complete catastrophe.

There are some interesting points here:

* Cities along the coast are at extreme and imminent risk.  It is
easy to assume the threat is overstated, but at the same time,
[Houston's 2017
flooding](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/08/latest-photos-of-harveys-disastrous-flooding/538590/)
demonstrated the potential severity.
* Cities are always downplaying risk in their bonding documents.
Part of this is the unwillingness of rating agencies to call them
out.
* Something I have pointed out for years is that eventually, the
rating agencies will be leading the thrust of the response to climate
change.

This may seem a bit contrived, but I do think it is the natural
extension of the early work on climate change done by the major
insurance companies.  Specifically, both [Swiss

and [Munich
Re](https://www.munichre.com/en/group/focus/climate-change/index.html) have
been pointing out the risks from an insurance standpoint for more
than a decade.

In many ways, fighting climate change has been pitched as
[anti-business](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/global-warming-skeptic.html#.Wncov1Q-fMU).
But that's only half the story.  Many businesses will be negatively
affected by climate change but figuring out exactly which ones will
be the challenge.
