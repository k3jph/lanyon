Chase, Ducky, and I went to [NASA Goddard Visitor Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/visitor/home) to launch rockets last weekend.  We like to launch [Estes Rockets](http://www.estesrockets.com/) and I designed my first rocket from parts that flew last weekend.  Sometimes, the rockets land on top of the Visitor Center, but that's not what this story is about.

They usually have someone on the roof who throws the rockets down when they land up there.  We had trouble finding mine, and from the roof, he said, "I just had eye surgery, so I've got 20-20 now.  I can't see your rocket anywhere," as he scanned the nearby woods.  What struck me in the moment was the casual tone of noting he'd just had a dramatic body modification that had improved his life.  But I've posted of [casual transhumanism](https://jameshoward.us/2014/09/22/cheap-biohacking/) before.

We never found the lost rocket.
