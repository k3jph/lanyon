I received word back from the [2016 Joint Statistical Meetings](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/).  As noted back in February, [I proposed to JSM a presentation on retrospective social discount rates](https://jameshoward.us/2016/02/08/historical-social-discount-rates/).  This came from my dissertation and you can read more about it there.  Yesterday, I got word that my proposal had been [accepted for a SPEED presentation](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=213152).  At the speed presentation, I will be talking for 5 minutes.  [Then I will have an e-poster session later in the day.](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=213221)

In addition, I will be chairing a [session on behalf of the Section on Statistics and the Environment](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=212890).  The topics for that presentation are:

* Is Gun Violence Contagious? Descriptive spatiotemporal testing and modeling with large-scale point process — Charles Loeffler, University of Pennsylvania ; Seth Flaxman, University of Oxford ; William Herlands, Carnegie Mellon University ; Hannes Nickisch, Philips Research Hamburg
* Spatio-Temporal Error Characterization of Geophysical Variables using Collocation Methods — Seyed Hamed Alemohammad, Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Kaighin A. McColl, Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Alexandra G. Konings, Stanford University ; Dara Entekhabi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
* A penalized quasi likelihood approach for variable selection in high dimensional spatially correlated binary and count data — Abdhi Sarkar, Michigan State University ; Chae Young Lim, Seoul National University ; Tapabrata Maiti, Michigan State University
* Approximate Optimal Weighted Composite Likelihood Approach for Large Spatial Data — Furong Li, Texas A&M University ; Huiyan Sang, Texas A&M University
* Process-based hierarchical models for coupling high-dimensional LiDAR and forest variables over large geographic domains — Andrew Finley, Michigan State University ; Sudipto Banerjee, University of California Los Angeles ; Yuzhen Zhou, University of Nebraska-Lincoln ; Bruce Cook, NASA
* Semiparametric Inference via Sparsity-Induced Kriging for Massive Spatial Datasets — Pulong Ma, University of Cincinnati ; Emily Lei Kang, University of Cincinnati
* Global Nonstationary Spatial Covariance Through Deformations and Geographical Indicators — Jaehong Jeong, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ; Marc Genton, KAUST

Needless to say, I am quite excited about Chicago this year.
