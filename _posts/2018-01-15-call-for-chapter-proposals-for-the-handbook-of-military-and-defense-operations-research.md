I am happy to say Prof. [Natalie Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com/)
of Towson University and I will be editing a new book called _Handbook
of Military and Defense Operations Research_, to be published by
CRC Press in late 2019 or early 2020. We are seeking case studies,
essays, and positional papers to illustrate applications of operations
research and analytics techniques within the military, national
defense, and homeland security sectors. We envision this book aiding
educators who teach military and defense applications, especially
at service academies, as well as practitioners transitioning into
military and defense analyst roles.

You can read the [full call for proposals](/mdor) or [submit your
abstract online](http://bit.ly/MDORAbstracts).
