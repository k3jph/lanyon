While I was [at NASA Goddard](/2017/10/24/going-nasa-social/) last
month, I saw the awesome [ICESat-2](/2017/11/24/icesat-icesat-2/),
which is going to shoot lasers down at the ground.  But shooting
lasers at the ground is so awesome, NASA is also going to do it
with the [GEDI mission](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/gedi).
So, first of all, it is pronounced like _Jedi_, and you just have
to get used to it.

The GEDI mission will be shooting a different laser at the ground,
which unlike ICESat-2's, will not be visible.  But it will shoot.
And the laser will provide range data on the vegetation cover for
the ground.  This vegetation information provides two critical
pieces of data about climate change.  First, we will be able to see
how much climate change is affecting vegetation, especially large
carbon sinks like the Amazon rain forest.  Second, we will be able
to measure approximately how much carbon will be demanded by that
vegetation and we will know, versus our output, how much excess
carbon is being released into the atmosphere.

In addition to working a bit differently and with a different mission
from ICESat-2, it will also fly differently.  The ICESat-2 satellite
is independent and will fly in a polar orbit, giving it a view of
the entire planet every few days.  But GEDI is instead a
refrigerator-sized box that will be sent to the [International Space
Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html)
(ISS).

The ISS has a number of instrument bays which allow for experiments
and tools to be swapped out.  GEDI will take its place and measure
the ground cover from the ISS.  This makes it somewhat cheaper to
build, but it also means it will not be able to see the entire
planet, due to the ISS's orbital incline.

GEDI is part of the much larger [Earth Observing
System](https://eospso.nasa.gov/), a set of tools and observing
platforms that collect information on weather, position, climate,
biomass, and the oceans.  Together, this information makes weather
predictions, shipping information, and even major construction
projects.  GEDI will be joining the EOS family of platforms when
it is launched in 2018.
