Mathman strikes again.  Here's a nifty picture I have
[borrowed](https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html)
from Cracked.com.  The text, by [Cracked user
RainbowCrash](http://www.cracked.com/members/RainbowCrash/), says,
"Manhole covers are round so that they cannot possibly fall through
their own holes.  Any shape other than a circle would be able to
fit through in at least one way."

Curiously, [RainbowCrash's
profile](http://www.cracked.com/members/RainbowCrash/) advertises,
"I'm not stupid anymore!"  So let's help him out here.  There are
shapes, other than a circle, that meet this definition.  The
requirement, when generalized, is that it must be a curve of constant
width.

[Wolfram defines](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CurveofConstantWidth.html)
this as "Curves which, when rotated in a square, make contact with
all four sides. Such curves are sometimes also known as rollers."
I am not a fan of this definition, but it does describe the
implications quite nicely.  A circle is well known for this, but
so is a curvilinear triangle, formally known as [a Reuleaux
triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle).  Not
only can this shape described a manhole cover, San Franciso uses
them for it!
