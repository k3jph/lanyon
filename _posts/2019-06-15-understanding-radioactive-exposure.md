Like a lot of people, I've been watching the [HBO](https://www.hbo.com/)
miniseries, _Chernobyl_:

In fact, I subscribed to HBO for this, rather than _Game of Thrones_,
which I still have not seen. Anyway, the miniseries is remarkable
and while we know it took some liberties with reality in order to
facilitate the story, those liberties have generally held to the
spirit of the story. For instance, all of the scientists involved
were [collapsed into the composite character of Ulana
Khomyuk](https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/film-and-tv/emily-watson-on-her-new-tv-drama-chernobyl-1-4920211),
and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

But two stories are continuing to be discredited. The first is about
the [Bridge of
Death](https://www.mamamia.com.au/chernobyl-bridge-of-death/), a
story that has been debunked more than once and before the miniseries
was written. But another is more insidious and that is the story
of Lyudmilla Ignatenko, a real person who is still alive as I write
this today. [_Forbes_ ran an
article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/06/11/top-ucla-doctor-denounces-depiction-of-radiation-in-hbos-chernobyl-as-wrong-and-dangerous/#55b81821e072)
a couple of days ago about an American physician, [Robert Peter
Gale](http://robertpetergalemd.com/), who worked with the victims
in the Soviet Union and there is one very important sentence in
this article:

> Gale, who worked for UCLA at the time of the accident, says that
the firefighters who suffered from Acute Radiation Syndrome were
not contagious, as they are portrayed as by HBO's "Chernobyl."

This is important because it highlights a long-lasting misunderstanding
of how radiation exposure works. Much of this has been driven by
media portrayals of radiation victims in fiction (cf,
[Spider-Man](https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-man-peter-parker),
etc.). When we say someone has been exposed to radiation, there are
two things this might mean and they are very different from both a
treatment and contamination perspective.

So, as I said, there are two types of "exposure" to radiation. In
the first, we can say someone has actually just been exposed to
radiation, that is, they saw it. Think of it as one of those Halloween
glowsticks. If one is glowing, and the light hits you, you have
been exposed to it. It lit you up, as one might say. As soon as you
get the glowstick in another room, or inside a box, or some way of
blocking the light, the exposure is over. If the radiation is
ionizing radiation, from a radioactive source, there is danger from
exposure, but the danger ends when the exposure is blocked. You
might still get sick, but things will not get worse.

In the second type of exposure, someone might have absorbed the
radioactive material. Sticking with the glowstick analogy, now
imagine you have eaten one. Now it is inside you, glowing. It will
be hard to see through layers of fat and muscle, but it is there,
glowing. And it will keep glowing until it runs out of energy. This
is what happens when you absorb radioactive material.

Typically, this happens by breathing in radioactive dust, though
[eating something radioactive is not unheard
of](https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2011/03/28/contamination-in-goiania/).
Then, it is inside you, continuously exposing you until the source
runs out of energy. In the case of, for instance, caesium-137, it
loses about half its energy every 30 years. It's not just going to
expose you, but everything you come in contact with. In this way,
radioactivity can be "contagious" because you would expose those
around you. That said, unless they eat you, they themselves cannot
become carriers, since it is stuck in you.

This is why, in the series, the clothing was stripped from the
firefighters and left in the basement of the hospital in Pripyat.
Their clothing was covered in this stuff, but they had not absorbed
much of the material. It didn't mean they were not going to become
ill, but generally, they could not irradiate those around them.

At the end of the day, this turns out to be a complicated question,
with respect to radioactive dust. If you have ever played with
glitter, and are perhaps familiar with the
[meme](https://www.google.com/search?q=glitter+herpes), you are
probably aware of two things. First, glitter gets everywhere. Second,
glitter seems to transport. The result is you tend to find glitter
in places you didn't expect and long after you thought it was cleaned
up. Radioactive dust works in kind of the same way. Once it is let
loose, it can travel, seemingly on its own.
