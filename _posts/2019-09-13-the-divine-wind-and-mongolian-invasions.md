The Mongolian invasions of Japan marked an interesting turning point
in the history of the Mongolian Empire. Kublai Khan, the [great
Mongolian general](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan)
tried invading in 1274 CE. Kahn's invasion force [launched from the
Korean
peninsula](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-mongol-invasions-of-japan-195559)
and included Chinese, Korean, and other forces, previously subjugated
by Kahn. Starting with 600 ships and 40,000 men, Khan tried to take
Japan.

The problem here, though, was one of nature. The fleets were sunk
by a Pacific typhoon. Even more interesting, Khan decided to try
again in 1281, and was again defeated by the weather. These two
storms have become [legendary in Japanese
culture](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141104-kamikaze-kublai-khan-winds-typhoon-japan-invasion/)
by the name of "kamikaze." Today, kamikaze is usually associated
with the [suicide pilots of World War
II](https://allthatsinteresting.com/kamikaze-pilots). But the word
itself means "divine wind" and are viewed as having been summoned
by the Emperor to defend the land.

Some historians have some problems with the accuracy of the kamikaze
legend, but recently, it seems some [studies of Japanese
lakebeds](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/mongol-smashing-kamikaze-typhoons-may-have-been-genuine)
suggest the storms may have been real. Despite the potential
historicity of the storms, it is unlikely they were actually summoned
by the Emperor.

It's worth noting, I think, that this story is not uncommon. The
British were under invasion by the [Spanish
Armada](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Spanish-Armada/)
in 1588, which was initially weakened by an Atlantic storm. Further,
the infamous "Russian Winter" assisted in the protection of Russia
during the Napoleonic and Nazi invasions in the 19th and 20th
centuries. The weather is critical on the battlefield.
