I've been a little busy lately.  I've been a touch occupied, as you
can imagine.  Not a lot of time for writing here.  But I had to
make some time for this.  Way back in 2015, which doesn't seem so
long ago, I was driving home from the train station and as usual,
I was listening to NPR.

A question came up about a sound effect we are all familiar with.
It is the characteristic typing sound on television and movies that
accompanies a display of text.  They were trying to find an origin
for this sound, which is distinctively the sound of a teletype:

> FORREST WICKMAN: Hello. Thank you.
>
> AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: So
we mentioned a couple films there, going back. When did you first
notice the sound, and why did you feel compelled to follow it to
the source?
>
> WICKMAN: Yeah, I first noticed it while watching
"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" last year, and the reason it really
jumped out at me is it was one of those shots where it just wasn't
necessary. You know, they showed a shot of London, and you could
see Big Ben right there and Westminster. And then they kind of
slowly zoomed in on a British flag, and right then it came up, you
know, saying, London, comma, England. And it just really made me
think about it. And I'd been hearing it all my life, but for the
first time, I just thought, you know, what is that noise?

Alone, I was talking back to the radio and said, "It comes from the
teletype in [_The Hunt for Red
October_](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hunt_for_red_october/)."  The
show continued...

> CORNISH: So where did your investigation lead you?  
>
> WICKMAN:
Yeah, I went back to some of the movies that you played in the intro
here and was trying to figure out where the earliest example of it
was. And eventually, I just ended up calling up a bunch of the, you
know, sound designers for these movies, and they all pointed me
back towards "The Hunt For Red October."
>
> CORNISH: "The Hunt For
Red October," a classic, but also involves submarines, right
(laughter)...

I was quite saddened that nobody was there to witness my awesomeness
at calling it.  You can listen to the full interview from NPR here:

This is probably where this story might have ended.  But last night,
through some convoluted logic,[1. Okay, for real, Ducky was insisting
George Washington was an alien.  And I recalled that on [_Alien
Nation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Nation_(film)), the
aliens were all named after famous people, so I looked to see if
there was a George Washington so I could blow her mind.  Then, I
recalled another show from about the same time...] I recalled a
late 1980s TV show called [_The War of the
Worlds_](http://horrorfuel.com/2018/02/06/tv-series-review-war-worlds-complete-series/),
following up on [the 1953 movie of the same
name](http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/188880%7C0/The-War-of-the-Worlds.html).

I remember watching it as a kid, but really only remembered one
part and that was a discussion about Kellogg Air Force Base (which
never actually existed) and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  This
surely only stuck in my head because we lived about 15 minutes from
Wright-Patterson, and it was sort of a dominating feature of the
area.  A quick search on YouTube reveals that some of the episodes
have been uploaded, including the feature-length premiere.

So, I turned it on and sat down on the couch to see if this was bad
as I expected it to be.  Nostalgia usually is.  Throughout the first
half of the episode, locations are communicated to the audience by
showing an entrance sign.  Nothing unusual about that.  Here's the
first, where the location is explained as the "Fort Jericho Disposal
Site," and the sign makes that plain as day...even in the night.

But in the second half of the episode, things change.  We start
using the teletype method.  Here's the first, I think:

{% include youtube.html id="8GwZejrp1cY?start=3725&end=3728" %}

Okay, but only a moment later I thought to myself, "Doesn't this
predate _The Hunt for Red October_?"  It does!  _The Hunt for Red
October_ was released to theaters on March 2, 1990.  The first
airing of _The War of the Worlds_'s premiere, "The Resurrection,"
was October 7, 1988.  That's an 18-month jump backward!  So then I
decided to try something crazy.

IMDB has a search tool where you can put two works in and see who
the overlap is.  I was hoping to find a common sound designer or
foley artist or something.  Alas, it wasn't to be.  Over the entire
series and the movie, the only overlap was two people.  One was
[Steve 'Spaz' Williams](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931727/), a
visual effects artist.  The second was [Michael
Welden](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919702/), an actor whose
involvement with the show didn't occur until the end of the second
season.

But pushing the origin of the teletype back a good 18 months is
still an accomplishment.  I am going to guess it can go further
back.
