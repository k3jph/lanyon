The trolley problem is a relatively standard problem in ethics that
arose from Phillipa Foot in 1967:

> Suppose...the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer
from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one
track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is
bound to be killed.

The question posed is what should the driver of the runaway trolley
do.  The problem is complicated by the ethical and moral frameworks
that surround causation.  From a strictly utilitarian point of view,
the analysis is straightforward:  The driver should steer the trolley
onto the track with one person.  The single person will die, but
five will be saved.  This is outlined in [_Star Trek II: The Wrath
of
Khan_](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan)
when Spock summarizes the utilitarian stance by saying, "Logic
clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of
the few."

But ethics and morality come into play by asking the train driver
to make a decision.  If the train will kill five if no action is
taken, some interpret this as acceptable.  While it may be, by some
objective standard, better to only kill one, that requires the
positive action of the driver to be the cause, a situation some
find untenable.  However, studies have shown that something around
9 in 10 people will make the choice to sacrifice one to save five.

There are a number of interesting variants.  One of them further
explores the relationship between cause and effect and the relationship
to ethics.  Judith Jarvis Thomson posed this question,

> As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people.
You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it
by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there
is a very fat man next to you â€“ your only way to stop the trolley
is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to
save five. Should you proceed?

In this example, many object to the situation before realizing the
test is about ethics and not mechanics.  And, the logic of
utilitarianism still holds.  It is better that five should live at
the expense of one.  But ethically and morally, the analysis breaks
down differently because the proposed victim, the very fat man, was
not really a party to the problem to begin with.  Therefore, it is
unreasonable to draw him into the problem now, especially as the
agent of his own demise.   And many agree with this reasoning, as
[studies have shown respondents are less likely to push the
man](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf).

These dilemmas, which are dilemmas, [unlike the Monty Hall problem](),
present a different aspect of the challenge of risk assessment, and
estimating cost.  In each case, due to the problem set up, death
is certain, so making a decision should be straightforward.  However,
the original trolley problem and Thomson's variant, [plus many
others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), show the
distinction between the straightforward utilitarian analysis and
the results of ethical and moral thinking.  Questions about this
type of ethical dilemma date back to at least the [13th Century
when Thomas Aquinas
proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect) the
doctrine of double effect.  In his analysis, it acceptable to cause
harm for the benefit of others, provided the harm is not the intended
effect.

In addition, these are not mere abstract problems.  The ideas
underlying this turn up in governmental decision processes, known
as public choice theory.  One important decision rule focuses on
[Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency).
A solution is considered Pareto efficient if someone is made better
off without making anyone worse off.  That is a surprisingly difficult
bar to clear and a lesser standard is the [Kaldor-Hicks
criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency),
wherein those who are made better off compensate those who are made
worse off.

Looking forward, these questions are coming up in the context of
driverless cars.  A car driving must make decisions about changing
lanes and turning and when to do that.  While [driverless cars are
have an incredible safety
record](http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/googles-self-driving-car-is-ridiculously-safe),
it may come to pass that a driverless car is forced into no-win
situation and risk its own occupants or the occupants of another
car.{% fn %}
It is important to recognize there is no correct answer to the
trolley problem.  It is a thought experiment designed to elicit
critical thinking.  If you encounter it in the real world, the
correct result is whatever you can live with.  However, seeing it
come up in other contexts show where subtle variants can create
interesting solutions that are distinct from each other.
