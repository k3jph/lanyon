[Geoff Williams](http://www.usnews.com/topics/author/geoff_williams)
writes in the _U.S. News and World Report_ about how to manage a
basement flood and in this article, I talk about insurance, and how
your basement can flood after a fire.  Head over to [_U.S. News_
to read
more](http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2016-09-23/help-my-basement-is-flooded).[1.
Why does _U.S. News_ return 403 to some browsers, blocking embedded

Also, Geoff wrote a book on the [great flood of
1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1913), which
affected huge swaths of the Eastern United States, including along
the Miami River, where I grew up. His book, _Washed Away_, [is
available on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Washed-Away-Americas-Widespread-Terrorized/dp/1605985317).
