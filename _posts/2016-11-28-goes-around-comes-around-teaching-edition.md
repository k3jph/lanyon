This spring, I will be teaching something a bit different.  I will
still be teaching mathematics online for UMUC, but I will also be
teaching MSA 600 -- Foundations of Research Methods in Administration,
as part of the [Master of Science in
Administration](https://www.cmich.edu/Global/Programs/Pages/degrees.aspx?dc=MSA)
(MSA) program at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu).
This short course (six weeks) focuses on research techniques for
management, with the following objectives:

1. Determine administrative issues and topics that can be researched
within the private, public and not-for profit sectors.
2. Identify, collect, evaluate, and synthesize research and
professional literature to draw and support conclusions and make
recommendations.
3. Identify, evaluate, and synthesize research data to draw and
support conclusions and make recommendations.
4. Effectively and concisely communicate research findings, conclusions
and recommendations to others in written form using standard written
English (grammar, spelling, sentence structure, syntax etc.) and
following APA format.
5. Effectively and concisely present research findings, conclusions
and recommendations to others in oral form using appropriate visual
aids and/or presentation software.
6. Demonstrate an understanding of research methodologies by
developing a practice research proposal that may or may not be
applicable to the studentâ€™s MSA capstone project.

The MSA program itself draws on the technical aspects management
and blends aspects of both a traditional MBA program and a traditional
MPA program.  This course sets up a student for success both in the
program and after by giving them the framework for researching and
reporting results in an administrative framework.

On a personal level, it's interesting to be teaching this class.
Over six weeks, I will visit [Joint Base
Andrews](http://www.andrews.af.mil/) on three Fridays and three
Saturdays on behalf of Central Michigan University, which has long
partnered with the military to provide education on-base for the
local community.  In the 1980s, my father studied in the MSA program
at Central Michigan University.  He took his classes at [Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/), which was near our home
in Springfield, Ohio.  I do not think he completed the program,
though.  Still, it is kind of cool to be there now.

I will post the syllabus when it's ready.
