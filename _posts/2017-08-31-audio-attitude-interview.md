So everyone, as promised, here's the audio from this afternoon's
interview on [The Attitude with Arnie
Arnesen](www.wnhnfm.org/programs-2/attitude-w-arnie-arnesen/).  I
am in the first half.  I haven't listened to this all the way
through, so I cannot talk about what's happening in the second half.
But, you know, listen to it anyway.  I am sure it's fun.
