I usually write longer explainers, but it's not even necessary this
time, because that's how wrong the Baltimore _Sun_ is this time.

The flag comes from the arms of the [Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron
Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Calvert,_2nd_Baron_Baltimore).
Here, these the arms granted by the College of Arms no later than
1675:

   cap="The Arms of Cecil Calvert, Baron Baltimore, showing the Crossland shield"
   alt="The Arms of Cecil Calvert, Baron Baltimore, showing the Crossland shield" %}

Yes, the Crossland banner was adopted by secessionists in Maryland,
but they co-opted a symbol of the State of Maryland.  Suggesting
the Crossland banner is a racist emblem is just as bad as suggesting
the Confederate statues are not.  Fortunately, the Crossland banner
has been restored to its rightful place, representing Maryland and
her history for more than 350 years.

(I've been advised that Nina Basu will be fighting with me on
Facebook about this tomorrow morning.  That's okay, she'll catch
up to me in about six months...)
