Business need to look at environmental issues as existential risk issues.  Some have started worrying about access to water in the coming years.  According to London-based think tank, CDP, <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en-US/News/CDP%20News%20Article%20Pages/Water-risk-threatens-business-growth-for-worlds-largest-companies.aspx">some business are talking about the water issue</a>:

<blockquote>
  We live in a time of unprecedented demand for water and have seen the number of investors seeking accountability from companies on this issue through CDP rise more than fourfold in just four years. It is of grave concern that such a significant group of companies is failing to communicate management of water risks to their shareholders through our global system.
</blockquote>

Demand for water will increase due to rising standards of living and supply will decrease due to global climate change in the next few decades.  More effective allocation schemes will be needed worldwide very soon.
