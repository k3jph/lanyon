There's a myth that goes around that math exists in a bubble and
this is just something you have to do graduate, like some sort of
perverse challenge.  But math does not exist in a bubble, and math
professors are not trolls under the bridge taking a toll on the way
to commencement.  Math is a tool to analyze and understand the real
world.
