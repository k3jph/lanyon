I'm a bit behind the curve, but there's a a coming change to the
Mega Millions interstate lottery game.  Of course, as a statistics
nerd,{% fn %} [I've
talked about the lottery before](/tag/lottery/).  So when I got
this on my Facebook page, I was all into it:

{% include fbembed.html url="https://www.facebook.com/howardjp/posts/618380485632" %}

First, we need to take a look at the current game configuration.
Right now, tickets cost a dollar and the jackpot starts at $15
million.  Given the game configuration, we can estimate what the
expected value of a ticket is.  That is, if I spend a dollar, how
much can I expect to get back.

Using the basic statistical data about the Mega Millions, we can
build a quick spreadsheet to get the expected value.  The statistical
data comes from the [April 24, 2017 Meeting Book of the New York
State Gaming
Commission](https://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/04.24.2017Commission%20Meeting%20Book.pdf).
Page 34 contains the tables.

As we can see, the expected value of a lottery ticket is a loss of
77 cents.  That means that given a single random Mega Millions
ticket, of which there is an initial loss of $1 (to buy the ticket),
we'll get back 23 cents.  In practice, the return realized is not
quite so hot, much of the return comes from hitting the jackpot.
And that's highly unlikely.

After Halloween this year, we will see some changes to game.  First,
tickets will go to $2.  Second, the odds will change, by changing
the game configuration.  The base prize has also gone up to $45
million and the lower prizes are also reconfigured.  It's not worth
going into those details here, but we can see the new numbers back
on page 34.

As we can see, for every $2 spent, we can expect to lose $1.63.
That means a loss of 37 cents for every $2.  It's important to
understand that these values are all premised on the jackpot having
just reset to its baseline **and** there being only one jackpot
winner.  Parimutual splits, due to multiple jackpot hits, pushes
the expected value even lower.  Today, the Mega Millions is at $323
million.  That leads to an expected value of 42 cents.  Again, this
assumes no splits.

Now, it turns out whether or not this is better is up to your own
outlook.  But, as it is, [your chances of winning are still about
the same as the snowball](/2016/07/01/someone-will-win-probably-wont/).
