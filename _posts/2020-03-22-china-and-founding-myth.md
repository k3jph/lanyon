The founding myth of China revolves around the [Three Sovereigns
and Five
Emperors](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors).
Unlike later formal dynasties, even if prehistoric like the [Xia
Dynasty](https://history.followcn.com/2017/01/14/archaeological-discoveries-of-the-xia-dynasty/)
or [Shang
Dynasty](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-china/shang-dynasty). This
period, before the Xia Dynasty, came in the late Neolithic period
and probably ended between 2100 and 2050 BCE. While prehistoric,
we know of it from later [oracle
bone](http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp363-ss13/2013/03/28/oracle-bones/)
inscriptions. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were likely
mythical, but that does not matter much because the they provided
key examples of how to govern that would lay the foundation of
Chinese of political thought to this day.

The distinction between the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors is
important because the Three Sovereigns were regarded as god-kings,
those from another plane who came to Earth. They came and used
special powers to heal the sick and tend to individual lives. In
addition, they introduced the Chinese people to what we might call
staples of civilization such as [agriculture and
writing](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/history-3-sovereigns.htm),
though no written records survive. Their time in China led to a
period of great peace and prosperity as people adapted to their new
ways of life and benefited from economic and societal changes.

The Five Emperors, on the other hand, were ordinary men, but are
traditionally regarded as providing similar contributions. One,
Huangdi (the Yellow Emperor), is said to have given the [Chinese
people medicine and
mathematics](http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/sub1/entry-5386.html).
Another, Zhuanxu, dammed numerous streams, and Shun was the hero
of a great flood. Together, we see an early civilization going
through trials and tribulations, and giving credit to leaders for
surviving those trials. How much of this was the result of the
Emperor or the Emperor receiving credit for the work of the society
is not clear.

The entire period of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors is
viewed as a gilded age [in Chinese
history](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/history-5-emperors.htm),
as the times of founding myths often are. The Five Emperors would
later be held up as embodying the important features of leadership
of different philosophical schools, during the [Hundred Schools of
Thought](https://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s02.html)
period. In particular, they would dominate the thinking of later
[Confucianists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) who saw,
in particular Emperor Yao, as ruling with supreme benevolence and
grace.
