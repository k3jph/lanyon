I have written a new extra credit problem for my college algebra
students!

> Hello, everyone. We're getting to that point in the semester when
students start asking the question every professor hates: Can I get
extra credit? Now, I will say something really important here and
that is I do not like extra credit at all. Most of the time, the
question could be rephrased, "Can I attempt extra work and get more
credit for it?" like we're talking about a prison term. And the
answer to that is no, not really. Never.

> But. I really like the idea of extra credit when the work is
something above and beyond the course material. When it is something
that truly expands on what you are doing. When it's something, you
know, _extra_.

> And I think I have a good one. Watch this video of 8 amazing fire
tricks.

> If the embed does not work, you can [click
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbvX4wJqPHg) for the entire
video. From 1:22 to 1:32, there is a pool of blue water and a
floating candle that is burning. A clear glass is placed over the
candle so that it is in the water and the candle is isolated.
Eventually, the candle goes out as we might expect…and the blue
water level under the class rises!

> The extra credit question is, how high will the water rise?

> There's a lot of assumptions we need to make to figure this out.
I am going to kick off some off right here:

> 1.  Assume the glass is a perfect cylinder.  
> 2.  The mouth of
the glass has a diameter of 10 centimeters.  
> 3.  The height of
the glass from the water-level to the top of the glass (which, since
it is upside down, is really the bottom) is 30 centimeters.

> You may need to make additional assumptions…I haven't solved the
problem yet. If you need to make one, and would like assistance is
making sure it is reasonable, feel free to ask. You should ask here,
so that the assumptions made are common to everyone.

> Now, there's a lot of science and math that should go into solving
this problem, but it does not require anything you would not have
learned in either high school or this class. Again, feel free to
ask any questions you need to right here, again, so everyone can
benefit from the responses.

> The extra credit project is due no later than the final exam due
date. There is no specified form for the response, other than you
must explain your answer, and that goes way beyond showing your
work on this one. This will contribute up to 5 percent on your class
grade.

> Good luck, we're all counting on you!
