I am happy to announce that [John F.
Beyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-beyers-ph-d-8948a59/), of
the University of Maryland University College, and I will be editing
a new book called _Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online_, to
be published by [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com) in 2019. I
have known John since 2010 when I started teaching as [an adjunct
at UMUC in the math department](/teaching). Over the
years, I realized there were difficulties and hard parts of teaching
mathematics via distance education, different from what you see in
an English or history course.

We want this book to collect the leading ideas and practices of
teachers and professors at every level, and serve as an open exchange
of good practices for teaching mathematics and statistics online.
You can read the full [call for chapter proposals here](/tlmo).
