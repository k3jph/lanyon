Well, _CMNA_ has been out for nine months and I got my first notice
of mistakes in the text.  There are three, related mistakes in the
section on evaluating formulae and were caught by [Vahab
Khademi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vahab-khademi-22b78628/).  I
have now posted an errata sheet on the _[CMNA](/cmna)_ page and
will keep it updated if further corrections are warranted...which
I am sure they are!  So if you should happen to find any, please
let me know.
