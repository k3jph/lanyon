The [Columbia Association's](http://www.columbiaassociation.com) Board of Directors has asked the Budget Committee to reassemble and look into the following:

> At this time, the PSC would like to send the issue of the long-term financial impact on the Columbia Association by the reduction of the annual Assessment Cap from 3% to 2% to the Budget Advisory Committee (BAC) for further analysis. Additionally the PSC would like to have a report on the findings of the BAC on this issue by mid-April so that there is time to react to the findings in this fiscal year.

The schedule of meetings will be posted when available.
