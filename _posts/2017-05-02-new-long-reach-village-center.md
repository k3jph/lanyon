This evening, the kids and I walked over to the Long Reach Village
Center, where got to see the new plan for the Long Reach Village
Center.  I will say here what I said there.  A long time ago, I sat
on the [Master Plan Committee](/service/long-reach-community-association)
for Long Reach and wanted to see something open, inviting, green,
but also viable.  I think they've nailed it.

But I was just a minor player.  The Village Board, the County, and
several bidders, all did a lot of work to pull this off.  The plan
is beautiful and hopeful in a place that's needed some for a long
time.  You can read more about it in the Baltimore Sun:

Howard County's Planning and Zoning has a [page about reimagining
Long
Reach](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Departments/Planning-and-Zoning/Community-Planning/Reimagine-Long-Reach-Village-Center)
that has a lot more information on it, including the proposal.

Here's to many more walks to our new Village Center!
