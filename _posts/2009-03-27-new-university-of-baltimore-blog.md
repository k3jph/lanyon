The University of Baltimore has a [new blog](http://ubaltblog.blogspot.com) written by those affiliated with campus and have selected me as an alumni blogger.  My posts will appear every Friday.  The first ran this morning, [Research at the Library](http://ubaltblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/research-at-library.html).
