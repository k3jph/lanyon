_Gary Woodson v. Allstate Insurance Company_ is an interesting [new
decision that just came out of the Fourth Circuit regarding flood
insurance](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/161935.P.pdf),
which transfers full jurisdiction over claims relating to flood
damage to the Federal courts, subject to the National Flood Insurance
Act.  This is quite big.

Historically, insurance regulation is handled at the state level.
Accordingly, there's not a huge body of law at the Federal level
on insurance.  So claims relating to flood insurance, even when
heard in Federal courts, are often guided by local state rules and
regulations.  As a result, each United States District has established
differing interpretations of the NFIP.  That makes interpretation
both inequitable and somewhat unpredictable.

Now, here in the Fourth Circuit, interpretation will be subject
only to Federal law, smoothing the process.  This decision should
be adopted by other circuits.
