I am teaching research methods again this fall, this time for Penn
State University.  I do love teaching research methods, and despite
having a busy fall ([though not as busy as it could have
been](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/ph-ca-at-district-12-primary-20180626-story.html)),
I took Penn State up on the offer.  Their approach to research
methods, that I really like, is that it is more quantitatively
focused than when I taught this at [Central Michigan
University](/2016/12/03/syllabus-for-foundations-of-research-methods/), or
even when I took it at the University of Baltimore.  That's probably
a good thing.

The downside is that Penn State is an
[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software)
campus.  We used SPSS when I took this at the University of Baltimore,
too.  Predictably, that was the last time I ever used SPSS.  For
anything.  It's certainly time we move on to using
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) for this class.  It's free and
starting to even get easy.

Anyway, the syllabus is posted over on my [management teaching
page](/teaching).
