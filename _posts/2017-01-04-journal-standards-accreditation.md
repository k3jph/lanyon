The New York _Times_ has an expos√© of the predatory academic
conferences market and swings through the predatory academic journals
market.  You can read the full article here, and it is well worth
reading:

{% include iframely.html url="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html" %}

But this opens up some interesting questions about how the academic
market can effectively self-regulate.  In the market for education
itself, this is handled through accreditation.  In accreditation,
a student is assured that a school meets some minimum standards and
if they do, they the credits and diplomas issued by the school will
generally be accepted by everyone else.  That means that at some
level, Howard Community College, the University of Maryland, and
the University of Pennsylvania are roughly equivalent.  This is
despite the fact one is a local community college, on is a major
state university, and one is an Ivy League school.  Now, obviously,
each offers different programs and has different reputations.  And
that's okay, too.  In practice, this mostly means that your calculus
class will[1. Probably.] transfer from school to school and you
won't have to take it again if you transfer.  But that's beside the
point.

Can we do the same thing for journals?  The answer is a very definite
maybe.  The problem is that there is no clear-cut definition of
what counts as a journal article.  We like to say a peer-reviewed
study is the bar, but that's only in some fields.  For instance,
law review articles are not usually peer-reviewed, but nobody
questions whether or not the _Harvard Law Review_ is a respectable
journal.  And Andrew Wakefield showed us a [peer-reviewed
article](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract)
in a respectable journal may not only be incorrect but can cause
real harm.

For journal accreditation to work, the academy must be willing to
define what the actual standards are.  These not even been consistent
across fields, so a board of student editors like a law review and
true external peer-review can both meet the standard.  The standards
will probably consist of a handful of cookie-cutter processes which
are generally believed to be acceptable combined with local practice
changes.  Provided a journal can itself meet standards of its peers,
it will pass.

Such a system won't be perfect, but it would be an improvement.
