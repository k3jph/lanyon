I've been working on some cybersecurity issues lately.  While I was
a network jockey [a couple of lifetimes
ago](/2015/07/15/atd-or-engineers-in-space/), it has been 15 years.
While the methods have changed, the motivations have also changed
and the risks are higher today than they ever have been.

So all of the sudden, cybersecurity is hot.  This is especially
true in the government space.  A surprisingly large number of my
students at UMUC are cybersecurity majors.  I can probably talk
theory, because that hasn't changed much.  But, specifics...ya got
me.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) comes to the rescue!  At this
point, Coursera's course listing is more daunting than a major
university's.  But buried in the course list are not one, but two
specialization tracks dedicated to cybersecurity.  Specialization
tracks are collections of related courses that provide a deeper and
more coherent learning experience than just one four-week course.

Coursera offers many courses and [at least eight cybersecurity
specializations](https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&query=cybersecurity),
provided by different institutions.  One specialization is provided
by [University of Colorado Colorado Springs is dedicated to
cybersecurity for
business](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security-business).
This specialization focused on the basics and is designed to give
the learner a basic vocabulary and ideas of how modern cybersecurity
works and is designed to last 20 weeks.

I chose this program and completed it last month.  You can [view
my certificate on Coursera's
website](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/XLPFY28LXR7S).
The final project was by far the most interesting part because they
give you access to a fairly insecure webserver and expect you to
determine information and if possible, take control of the system.
There's also a file they'd like you to find the contents of leading
to a "capture the flag" kind of game.  If you're looking for a
cybersecurity primer and are not planning on becoming a fully-fledged
cybersecurity expert, this is a great program and I recommend it.
