[Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10) included a plaque, shown above.  Pictographically, it shows humans, where we are, and where we come from.  Just in case anyone should ever find it and get curious.  At the bottom is a representation of the Solar System to help identify home...with nine planets.

That highlighted planet is Pluto.  Now that [they demoted Pluto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pbj_llmiMg), the aliens will never be able to find us.
