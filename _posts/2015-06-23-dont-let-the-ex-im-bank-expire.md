From my latest piece in The Conversation, why we should not let the charter for the Export-Import Bank of the United States Expire:

<blockquote>
  Almost 90% of its loans support small businesses, which generated $10.7 billion in exports from these companies last year, according to the bank. That’s helped it support 1.3 million private sector jobs since 2009.
  
  Without this support, many small businesses wouldn’t be able to compete with foreign competitors in overseas markets. Governments in many countries subsidize local businesses, while potential US customers often have a hard time securing financing to buy American products.
