This semester, I've been [teaching a course I don't normally
teach](/2017/03/06/syllabus-intermediate-algebra/).
This has been an interesting experience.  The course is wholly
online, so we have "homework," and "quizzes," and "tests," but these
are not really different from each other.  They are all open book
and open Google.  Except for the final exam, which has a 72-hour
window, all material is given at least a week before it is due.
Because of these constraints, it can be difficult to construct
assessments that meaningfully gauge a student's ability.

What I have done this semester is use the standard homework problems
for "homework."  These are questions that are simple drill problems
and occasional word problems.  But for the "quizzes," I have used
word problems.  I've used some from an older textbook that align
with our material for the week.  These problems provide a set of
circumstances and then ask a series of mathematical questions about
it.  Those questions exercise what we learned in a meaningful way.
In other words, [application and
analysis](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).

This has lead to a small, but dedicated, group of students who
object to the use of word problems as assessment.  The overall
concern seems to be the quizzes do not reflect the material.  I
have given the students a lengthy explanation of how and why this
assessment is both valid and best for the purpose of the course.

However, the student complaints have continued and seem to focus
on the idea that as the customer, the student should have their
demands met.  But students are not customers...they are students.
Frankly, students are not the primary obliger of funds.  Setting
aside the question of who may be paying for a student, we must
understand that a student never pays full freight for their education.

At a public school, the taxpayer is a partner and real customer of
the education provided.  At a private school, the donors are.  Both
want to create an education population because they benefit from
it.  Students may be contributing through tuition, but that's not
paying the full way.  We ask students to pay for the same reason
health insurance companies require a copayment for service.  It
places some cost on the consumer.

A cost-sharing arrangement like a copayment does not meaningfully
reduce costs for an insurance company directly.  The cost-sharing
deters the use of insurance for things that could have been prevented
another way.  Economically, we call say copayments reduce moral
hazard.  The consumer avoids unnecessary expenses for the insurance
regime because the consumer too has some skin in the game.  But in
a doctor's office, you should never get confused and think you're
the customer.  The insurance company is.

Similarly, students pay tuition to keep some skin in the game.  But
the real customer, as always, is who is really paying the bill.
