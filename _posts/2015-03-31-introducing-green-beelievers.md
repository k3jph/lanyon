I haven't posted about our nonprofit project in a while, so here's an update.  We got through Spring Break, but just before, the class decided to call the nonprofit "Green Beelievers," where the extra e is an allusion to the University of Baltimore's [Eubee Bee](http://www.ubalt.edu/campus-life/the-ub-bee/index.cfm).  We are adopting a small park across the street from the University's Liberal Arts and Policy (LAP) building on Morton Street.

The nonprofit is more or less up and running.  We elected a board of directors comprising everyone in the class and myself.  We are having weekly meetings during the last half-hour of class every week.  We've got an [EIN](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online) and should have a bank account soon.  

We're holding a fundraiser in the next few weeks.  It will be a happy hour somewhere near the University of Baltimore campus and we'll be inviting the entire UB community.  With luck, we'll hit our fundraising target and have a great time.
