The time has come for Howard County to do the easy thing and separate
the Zoning Board from the County Council. The business of local
government, other than policing, is basically land use. This covers
zoning, planning, permitting, and all the associated facets of
trying to build something new. There are many different boards,
departments, and decision makers in most local governments that
handle this. For an academic treatment of this, [_Implementation_
by Jeffrey L. Pressman and Aaron Wildavsky](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0520053311") 
describes this in detail.

In Howard County, we have several different boards. But the most
interesting, from a governance perspective, is the Howard County
Zoning Board. There are two Zoning Authorities provided for in [ยง
16.200 of the Howard County
Code](https://library.municode.com/md/howard_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=HOCOCO_TIT16PLZOSULADERE_SUBTITLE_2ZO_S16.200ZOAUDESHTI).
The first is the "Zoning Authority for comprehensive zoning and for
amendments to the text of the Howard County regulations" and is the
County Council. The second is the "Zoning Authority for piecemeal
zoning map amendments and decisions on development plans" and is
the Howard County Zoning Board.

The problem comes a bit later in [ยง 16.201 of the Howard County
Code](https://library.municode.com/md/howard_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=HOCOCO_TIT16PLZOSULADERE_SUBTITLE_2ZO_S16.201AU)
which says Zoning Board "shall consist of the members of the County
Council." Because of this, sometimes the County Council is doing
its business as the County Council and sometimes as the Zoning
Board.[1\. It is also the Board of License Commissioners for Howard
County under state law, commonly called the "Liquor Board," which
should not be confused with the Appointed Alcoholic Beverage Hearing
Board, also commonly called the "Liquor Board." You know what,
that's a different post.] By and large, this should not be a big
deal, if a bit weird. However, there is broad concern among many
that contributions from those with business before the Zoning Board
are contributing to those members' campaigns. There are [proposed
regulations that would limit the
contributions](https://www.peoplesvoicellc.org/) that would curtail
such contributions. These proposed regulations are of questionable
constitutionality, though.

So let's address the issue a different way. The Zoning Board can
become a separate agency. The specifics of its construction are not
important. It can be appointed by the [County
Executive](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Branches/County-Executive) with
County Council confirmation, like almost all of the county boards
and commissions. It might be appointed directly by the County
Council, like the Board of Appeals. It might have a dedicated member
from each Council district, though it might be better if not.

But here's the kicker. Changing this does not require permission
from the Maryland General Assembly. The structure of the Zoning
Board is governed by the local code. The County Council can pass a
bill changing the structure and it will be effective after the
signature of the County Executive.

The only real question is how to handle changes to the Zoning Code.
An independent Zoning Board would, presumptively, have the same
authority as the current Zoning Board to hear piecemeal map changes
and development plans. And as a county board, the Zoning Board would
be subject to the same ethics rules and disclosures as every other
county board.

However, the role the County Council has two roles still, comprehensive
zoning and changes to the zoning regulations, commonly called ZRAs.
Comprehensive zoning should probably be handled by the County
Council, still.

But ZRAs are changes to the law. In Howard County, we have two
complete and distinct "bodies" of law, the Howard County Code and
the Howard County Zoning Regulations (HCZR). Both are adopted by
and maintained by the Howard County Council. We generally think of
"regulations" as being adopted by administrative agencies, like the
FCC. Those regulations are subordinate to and authorized by enabling
legislation. How ZRAs, and the HCZR, are handled in this future
scenario is a sort of open question.

A typical ZRA will change the HCZR to change what is permitted in
a given zone, usually in the conditional uses list. Someone has a
specific use in mind and if is not permitted, a ZRA will be submitted
to make it so. If a ZRA creates or changes a conditional use, then
the applicant still has to go through the Hearing Authority, a
quasi-judicial process. These ZRAs do not bypass that process; they
simply let you ask for permission.

One option is to transfer the handling of the HCZR to the newly
independent Zoning Board. This may work if there is a substantial
framework for governing how the HCZR should be implemented. Personally,
I think it is the best option, but also the hardest to actually do,
setting aside the political hurdles it would encounter. I really
do not think anyone has the stomach to do the work required to make
it work.

It is probably best to leave the ZRAs with the County Council. This
is probably not a bad idea as ZRAs are often done at the best of a
single applicant but apply equally to everyone. Further, the interests
of [incrementalism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/973677) suggest
this is easier to accomplish. And it would reduce the number of the
perceived issues of independence by zoning decision makers.
