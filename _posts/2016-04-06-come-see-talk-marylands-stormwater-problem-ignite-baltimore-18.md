Hey everyone, [Ignite Baltimore](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/) has announced the lineup for Ignite Baltimore #18 and I am pleased to say I am there.  I will be talking about Maryland's stormwater management problem.  I was lucky to have talked at [Ignite Howard County](https://jameshoward.us/2015/09/14/why-this-hammer-costs-435/) last September, as the Ignite format is fun and brisk and forces you you figure out what the core message quickly.  It's on April 21 at [MICA](https://www.mica.edu/Browse_Art/Brown_Center.html) and you can get tickets on Eventbrite!
