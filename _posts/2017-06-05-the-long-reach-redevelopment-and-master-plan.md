The legislation supporting the [redevelopment of the Long Reach
Village
Center](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Departments/Planning-and-Zoning/Community-Planning/Reimagine-Long-Reach-Village-Center)
has been submitted to the Howard County Council.  It leads me to
want to share some of the things we talked a lot about during the
[Master Plan process](/service/long-reach).  This is based solely
on my recollection and should not be considered official.

## The Boundary

First, we had a very difficult time establishing the boundary of
the Village Center.  There's an apartment complex, now known as
[the Timbers at Long Reach](http://www.thetimbersatlongreach.com/)
just behind the shopping center, down Cloudleap Court.  Back in the
mid-2000s, it was called Lazy Hollow and I lived there.  In addition,
the area down Foreland Garth includes a church and an apartment
complex.  Finally, between Foreland Garth and Old Dobbin Road is a
large amount of open space supporting the BGE high tension lines
that run north/south through east Columbia.

I argued all of this should be included within the Village Center
boundary.  This would enable a future developer to have access to
a great deal of land, some of it already dedicated open space, and
the ability to redevelop the apartments, which could only have been
an improvement.  In particular, the ability to redevelop the Timbers
would give a future developer the access to several dozen acres
below the neighboring ground level.  Further, since residential
would certainly be coming into a redeveloped Village Center, adding
the apartments would likely lead to a lower net addition of units.

The Committee, ultimately, rejected this and made the Village Center
the shopping center and the associated gas station and the open
space under the BGE lines.

## Residential

We knew residential was necessary for a future developer's interest.
The market can no longer support a destination grocery store in
every village, and a standalone big-box-store resembles a strip
center more than a vibrant residential community hub.  At the same
time, local stores, the kind we want like coffee shops, boutiques,
and personal services, need the foot traffic to support them.  Kids
walking to and from the high school won't be enough.

So we planned on residential.  In addition, we knew the residential
component would be able to offset much of the other costs associated
with redevelopment.  This is just a fact of life.  Small commercial
centers are not financially viable as standalone operations.  Given
the [continuing shrinking of
retail](https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2017/06/02/this-is-a-death-spiral-the-tsunami-of-store-closures-is-doubl/22123258),
this should be no surprise.  So we expected mixed-use.  This
manifested in these critical three sentences in the Master Plan:

> While Long Reach is not adverse to a mixed-use approach to any
redevelopment of the village center, we feel that a strong emphasis
should be placed on the retail portion in a way that will enhance
the daily lives of Long Reach’s and the surrounding neighborhoods’
residents.
>
> If done correctly, the use of a housing component in the village
center could help attract a unique variety of vendors to enhance
the shopping experience. It would also increase foot traffic and
provide a vibrancy to the village center.

In other words, we were willing to embrace residential if done
right.

## Greening the Village Center

Right now, the Village Center is a concrete slab with a handful of
storefronts around it.  We wanted some place where we could be.
Where we wanted to be.  So it was important to us to see a site
where there was something green, providing recreation and grounding.
We also wanted to eliminate the [risks associated with acres of
pavement](/2016/04/24/watch-ignite-talk-stormwater-management/).
So we made sure we included that.  But we also wanted it to be
sensible.  So the plan included this:

> Redevelopment should also incorporate green building standards,
water conservation, native plantings.

Simple, elegant, and achievable.  We expected the Village Center
Redevelopment to be in harmony with its surroundings.

## The Results

We got lucky.  Howard County bought the property in 2014 and after
a lengthy, professional, and public bidding project, the County has
nominated a brilliant plan by Orchard Development that really does
what we wanted.  It provides sensible residential, with excellent
options for shopping and services.  And, frankly, it completely
exceeds what we asked for in green space and sense of place.  The
vertical garden, for instance, is a wonderful contribution that
will allow new local restaurants to service food grown in the Village
Center!

This plan, when adopted by the County Council, will accomplish a
great project in Columbia.  It will give Long Reach a new vibrant
core, not unlike we are seeing in Downtown Columbia.  But it will
also do it on a scale respectful of the neighbors, the village, and
our history.
