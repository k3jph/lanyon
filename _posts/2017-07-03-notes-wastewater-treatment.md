Chase, I think in an attempt to avoid bedtime, asked me on Friday
what happens to the water after it leaves the bathtub.  Well, lucky
for him, I spent a lot of time growing up in the [LeSourdsville
Regional Water Reclamation
Facility](http://des.butlercountyohio.org/html/wastewater/LeSourdsville.cfm).
[My father](2007/03/09/eulogy-for-james-patrick-howard) had worked
in the LeSourdsville Facility for just about 15 years when died.
He worked second shift, so, especially if I had a [late
class](2016/08/30/high-school-dropout-stopped-worrying-went-college), I'd
often run over at night.  We'd even grill in the parking lot.

Of course, it wasn't all fun and games.  At the time, I also worked
for [Butler County Information
Services](http://www.butlercountycommissioners.org/index.cfm?page=InfoServices).
So I had an ID and occasionally I'd fix a computer here and there.
But even then, I paid attention to what was around me and learned
the [SCADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) system they used.
I also learned the basics of how water gets treated before it was
dumped into the Miami River.  It sounds gross, but the LeSourdsville
effluent was cleaner than the Miami at the outlet.

Anyway, I explained the fundamentals of wastewater treatment to
Chase.  It's surprisingly simple.  Basically, remove the big stuff,
let the small stuff fall out, and let bacteria eat the rest.  What
you get is drinkable at the end, surprisingly.  Chase wanted more
detail, and we found an interesting video on YouTube.  Some of it
seems like a promotional video for a tax increase for the local
jurisdiction, especially the first 10 minutes, but the second half
is a really good description of the process:

It's also called "Flush to Finish," which is kind of funny.  The
part Chase never really believed was when I told him about the water
bears.
