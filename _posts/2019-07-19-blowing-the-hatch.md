Something caught my attention. I watched _[The Right
Stuff](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/)_ last night and was
looking up something about [Gus
Grissom](https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm).
Grissom's _[Liberty Bell
7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_4)_ flight has
been the subject of [great
controversy](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1999-12-09-9912090197-story.html)
over how the hatch was blown after splashdown. The hatch blow
resulted in a loss of the vehicle, though Grissom was rescued.

Three flights later, on the _Sigma 7_ flight, pilot Wally Schirra
was still in the Mercury spacecraft as it was hoisted aboard the
_USS Kearsarge_. [Wikipedia describes what
happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_8#Reentry_and_recovery),
moments before the picture above was taken:

> Forty minutes after landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge;
five minutes later, Schirra blew the explosive hatch and climbed
out to a waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed
clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch,
which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot
Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7
mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his
input; the fact that he had no bruising was seen as evidence that
he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it
was a mechanical malfunction.

I had never known Schirra did this and that is an interesting bit
of space trivia.
