Well, I may be [running a campaign for delegate right
now](https://jameshoward.md), but I still am teaching mathematics,
because that's just what I do.  I am teaching an intermediate algebra
class this term.  At UMUC, this class is [MATH
012](https://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/course-information.cfm?course=math012),
and it is not taught for college credit, but instead for "institutional
credit."  That is, the course does not count toward degree requirements
but does count toward the residency requirement at UMUC.

There's nothing special or interesting in this session, so this
post is just to say I have [posted the syllabus](/teaching/).
