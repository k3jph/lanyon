Colonial Virginia offers a different path toward governance. Jamestown
was [originally settled in
1607](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305748882902419).
Jamestown was not the first English colony in North America, but
the [Lost Colony of Roanoke](https://digital.lib.ecu.edu/13444) had
disappeared nearly two decades before and was never heard from
again. Jamestown's settlers were sent to North America to make a
profit on behalf of the [Virginia Company of
London](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2210786), an early [joint-stock
company](http://www.ushistory.org/us/2b.asp). Accordingly, the
Jamestown Settlement was organized and controlled from London in a
much more corporate fashion than [Iceland's haphazard
settlement](https://jameshoward.us/2017/09/28/democratic-norms-settlement-iceland/).

The governance of Jamestown was provided for by a [royal
charter](https://academic.oup.com/ajlh/article-abstract/7/2/95/1785250?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
issued by King James of England in 1606, which included the important
statement that residents of Virginia were subjects of the Crown.
The governance structure created a [local council for each
settlement](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20086394?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
in Virginia, but the colony and council ultimately reported to [Our
Council of
Virginia](https://lawlibrary.wm.edu/wythepedia/index.php/Seal_of_Virginia),
located in England and appointed by the Crown. Given this structure,
democratic authority was limited to certain matters. For instance,
the local governing council was given the authority to [coin money
and defend the
colony](https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-XqmJhl3dgTXSjsnZ/Howard-421%20THE%20BRIDGE%20AT%20JAMESTOWN%20%20%20VIRGINIA%20CHARTER%20%201606%20AND%20CONSTITUTIONALISM%20IN%20THE%20MODERN%20WORLD_djvu.txt).
On the other hand, the councils' authority were limited and final
authority rested with the Crown.

The first two years of the Jamestown settlement were extremely
difficult. The colony was beset by [drought and difficult
winters](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/280/5363/564).
Unable to produce sufficient food, starvation and famine [killed
more than half of the
settlers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03374329) by
1608, leaving only [John Smith well
enough](https://history.msu.edu/hst321/files/2017/05/HST321.kupperman-jamestown.pdf)
to serve as the one member of the settlement's governing council.
With these difficulties, the V[irginia Company sent Thomas
West](https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3403&context=annals-of-iowa),
the Lord De La Warr, to manage the colony directly, effectively
ending local democracy in Jamestown for the time being. This
situation, [including effectively military
rule](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/76/3/595/93592), continued
until 1619, when the first Virginia General Assembly was created,
with elected [representatives from each Virginia
settlement](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4241795).

In 1624, following years of "[years full of misrule, of cruel
disregard of human life and of selfish unconcern on the part of
those in authority](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25105836)," King
James stepped in and established [direct royal
control](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/222297) over
the colony, placing 1200 surviving residents of Virginia under
control of a royal governor and council. Local matters were still
addressed by the elected assembly with [laws requiring the
assent](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4321013123/sir-john-harvey-royal-governor-of-virginia-1628-1639)
of the royal governor. However, it was not until the House of
Burgesses became the lower house of the parliamentary system, along
with the dual executive-legislative role of the royal council, that
[American bicameralism took
hold](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343460509507680?journalCode=uctp20).
[Creating courts, laws, and maintaining order as
citizen-legislators](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25718871), the
model developed in Seventeenth Century Virginia spread to other
English colonies in the New World.

Taken together, during a period of less than forty years, a
corporate-based governance system was replaced with a modern
democratic system, though the system was still tied to the Crown.
Jamestown was the first [company
town](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/americas-company-towns-then-and-now-180956382/)
in the New World and the model did not work well because governance
from afar could not manage the real-world risks associated with the
shifting landscape across the Atlantic Ocean. Defending against
raids from Native American peoples and climatic challenges was more
than a remote business could attend to. Only by placing full and
local control in the hands of someone representing the Crown could
the Virginia colony succeed economically and politically.
