I was thinking about the Laplace transformation and the application
to the evaluation of improper integrals is really the most interesting
aspect to me. Now, that is mostly because I do a lot of statistics!
But, while thinking about the Laplace Transform, I pulled up the
Wikipedia page. You can see it here:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0" data-card-type="article"><h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform">Laplace transform</a></h4><p>In mathematics, the Laplace transform is an integral transform named after its inventor Pierre-Simon Laplace (). It transforms a function of a real variable t (often time) to a function of a complex variable s ( complex frequency). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.</p></blockquote>

But something completely unrelated caught my eye on that page, and
we are about to go down a completely irrelevant road, but it is
fun. So, some well known transformations are given on the page,
along with a source. For several of them, the source given is
"Bracewell 1978." Well, that's interesting. I found the full citation,
and sure enough, it's Ronald N. Bracewell:

> Bracewell, Ronald N. (1978), The Fourier Transform and its
Applications (2nd ed.), McGraw-Hill Kogakusha, ISBN 978-0-07-007013-4

You're probably thinking, who is Ronald N. Bracewell. In 1960, he
came up with the idea that one could send a robotic probe to another
star system to communicate with another civilization. This was
basically the plot of _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ and the Arthur
C. Clarke book, _Rendezvous with Rama_. It's also interesting because
all of the sudden, we've had two visitors from outside the solar
system, lately.

First, in 2018, an interstellar object
['Oumuamua](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/)
swung through our Solar System. Now all the sudden, a second
identifiably interstellar object has been identified,
[2I/Borisov](https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1910/). Now,
neither of these are likely Bracewell probes. But as the meme goes,
"I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens."
