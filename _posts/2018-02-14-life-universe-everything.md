The origin of life on Earth is a complicated question.  The first
thing we need to understand is that we don't really know the answer.
But we have some ideas about how it might have happened based on
what we do know about the early Earth and what the environment was
like.

First, we kind of have to define life, but even that is hard to
work with.  There is no uniformly accepted definition of what life
is.  But something we kind of think is key is the ability to
reproduce.  Of course, by this definition, some robots are alive,
but we can set that aside for now.  In addition, there's an entire
field of "[artificial life](http://alife.org/)" which uses computer
programs to model biological processes.  Some scientists use these
to study the origin of life.

But to get something "alive" in any reasonable sense, it probably
wants to make another.  It is the [biological
imperative](http://scientificintegrity.blogspot.com/2008/04/biological-imperative.html);
if we cannot find it later, then it won't last long.  So to find
the first biomolecule, some protein or amino acid, we are pretty
far down the list of things we need to get to first life.  [And
scientists are looking for that first
biomolecule.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128251-300-first-life-the-search-for-the-first-replicator/)

However, the upshot, is they are everywhere.  The most basic
biomolecules are just simple molecules with carbon at the center.
And the more interesting ones are bigger molecules with carbon at
the center.  And [carbon is quite
happy](http://science.jrank.org/pages/1202/Carbon-Why-carbon-special.html)
to bond with many other chemicals.  In fact, we have seen [amino
acids on
comets](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17628-found-first-amino-acid-on-a-comet/).
One astronomer notes:

> If you add hydrogen cyanide, acetylene and water together in a
test tube, and give them an appropriate surface on which to be
concentrated and react, you'll get a slew of organic compounds
including amino acids and a DNA purine base called adenine.

And those [chemicals have been observed throughout the
galaxy](http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18569) by
astronomers now.  Most think the building blocks of life are
everywhere.

So is Earth special?  I will guess not.  It happened here.  I know
this because my children are sitting next to me and [I think,
therefore, I
am](http://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-7/descartes-i-think-therefore-i-am).
We know it happened at least once.  Some argue that Earth is special
because in order for it to happen once requires a long series of
incredibly unlikely events to occur.  And I completely agree with
that, but come to a different conclusion.  While I am thinking, I
am a statistician.  And there was not a single opportunity for those
self-replicating molecules to form.

There were trillions all over the Earth, happening simultaneously
and over eons.  It wasn't one dice roll.  It was a zillion dice
rolls.  And when you have a lot of chances, [one of them is more
likely to come up your
way](/2015/10/27/probability-at-scale-and-kic-8462852/).  And you
only need one for life to spring forth.  The question is not how
improbable life is, but rather how many chances do you get.
Probability at scale is a beautiful thing.  That's why [someone
will win the lottery even though it probably won't be
you](/2016/07/01/someone-will-win-probably-wont/).
