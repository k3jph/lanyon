It is apparently time for another policysplainer. The New York
_Times_, among others, [covered the
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/social-security-medicare-insolvency.html)
that Social Security will start running a deficit in the next decade
and not long after, be insolvent. This really should not be a
surprise. The [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/)
pointed this out in [2016](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52298),
[2013](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44972), and
[2008](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/08-20-socialsecurityupdate.pdf).
Social Security's [Office of the Chief Actuary](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/)
has also been saying it for years. But it is suddenly news. And
this leads to stupid comments online.

This post from the _Journal-News_, a hometown newspaper, includes
many:

Here are a few samples:

*   "The government should pay back what they stole from our social
security."
*   "How can Social Security run out of money but welfare can't?…Ok
Congressional crooks please answer now!!!!"
*   "If they would stop stealing for the general fund, social
security was solvent till the trust fund got big enough politicians
wanted to start expanding FREE stuff programs!"

Congress does not raid the Trust Fund, like so many seem to think.
In fact, [Public Law
101-508](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/comp2/F101-508.html) is quite
clear that Congress cannot touch the Trust Fund for general purposes:

> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and
disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust
Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund shall not be
counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or
surplus for purposes of—

> 1. the budget of the United States Government as submitted by
the President,
> 2. the congressional budget, or
> 3. the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

But the myth persists and this seems to be based on the idea that
the Trust Fund has a lot of IOUs. What's really going on here is
that the Trust Fund has, for decades, run surplus. With cash on
hand, the Trust Fund needs to put it in the bank. For all government
funds, the "bank" is the Treasury Department. Treasury, when the
money is deposited, notes the balance. Of course, Treasury owes the
Trust Fund a lot of money and they know it. It is just like when
you put money in the bank. It's not in your hand, and the bank owes
you money.

And just like when you put money in the bank, Treasury pays interest.
This is really no different than if the Trust Fund were held in
T-bills. In other words, the Trust Fund is held in the same bonds
that everyone else is putting their money into. It also means that
of the $22 trillion or so of national debt we have, something between
$3 trillion and $4 trillion is actually held by the Trust Fund.

So when the OASDI Trustees make these predictions, it is based on
the assumption the deposits in Treasury are fully redeemed. And
that's a reasonable assumption. The problem is not that Congress
or the President is raiding the Trust Fund.

The problem is the program is not actuarily sound. The program is
not designed to be self-sustaining, but we cannot pin that entirely
on the original policymakers. The program is designed for a time
when people had a shorter average lifespan. That is it and that is
the entire problem. There are four ways this can be addressed.

1.  Raise the age at which payments begin. This makes sense as
people are working longer, anyway.
2.  Raise the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Right now,
the payroll tax is 7.65% paid by each employee and 7.65% paid by
the employer. Of that 7.65%, 6.2% goes to Social Security and the
rest goes to Medicare.
3.  Increase or remove the income cap on payroll taxes. That payroll
tax mentioned in the last paragraph is only up to an income of
$132,900 per year in 2019. If you make more than that, you are not
paying the payroll tax on anything over it. Raising taxes is always
criticized, but above $132,900 is only about the upper 7%. You know,
those who have significant income.
4.  Cut benefits. Besides being the [third rail of
policy](https://prospect.org/waldman/real-reason-social-security-third-rail-american-politics),
it is just a bad idea. Social Security already is [difficult to
live
on](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2018/live-off-benefits-alone.html),
if one has no private retirement.

Some combination of 1, 2, and 3 is the only way that makes any
sense. Social Security cannot be saved by cutting defense, cutting
welfare, or cutting anything else. The only way to save Social
Security is to deal with the statistical reality and adjust the
program, accordingly.
