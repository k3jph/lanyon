[James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com/210.html) writes, in a post, "Computer Science Courses that Don't Exist, But Should," a series of course descriptions for needed computer science courses, one struck me:

> Discuss and dissect historically significant products, including VisiCalc, AppleWorks, Robot Odyssey, Zork, and MacPaint. Emphases are on user interface and creativity fostered by hardware limitations.

That's a really good idea.  Some of these programs did some really amazing stuff in a very limited environment.  You could also add to this list the system software for the [Voyager spacecraft](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/), [Sixth Edition Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_6_Unix), and, of course, [the Story of Mel](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html).

By forcing programmers to understand the constraints of the machine, and seeing what fit in it, we'd all be a lot better off.  It would also better prepare a generation of embedded programmers.

It should also include the [Atari ET Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_video_game_burial).
