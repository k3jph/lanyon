Purveyors of various [Malthusian
models](http://cgge.aag.org/PopulationandNaturalResources1e/CF_PopNatRes_Jan10/CF_PopNatRes_Jan108.html)
like to compare the Earth and its population of humans to a pond
and a population of fish.  As we all know, a pond of a given size
will really only support at most a fixed number of fish.  The fish
pond is an important model.  I often use a fishpond, fixed by
logistic growth, as an example in precalculus.  I even used a
[dynamic two species
version](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lotka-VolterraEquations.html) to
demonstrate differential equations in _Computational Methods for
Numerical Analysis with R_.  But the logical jump to humans isn't
that simple.  Allow me to explain.

First, the fish pond, with its limited space is a lot like the
Earth. There are limited resources, such as space, food, and energy
available to each. If there are so many fish that some fish get
starved out, this will be a hard limit on population growth.  The
same is true for Earth. We, as people, have access to limited space.
There's an old quote, variously attributed to Mark Twain, Will
Rogers, [and probably by
neither](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1874407,00.html),
that goes, "Buy land, they aren't making any more of it." Using the
limited land we have, we can only produce so much food and provide
resources to care for so many people.

But, I think there's a substantial difference. Humans are capable
of engineering. We actually can [make more
land](http://www.dredgingtoday.com/2015/04/23/land-reclamation-at-hong-kong-airport-about-to-begin/).
We can improve the [efficiency of our
harvests](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89T01451R000100030001-1.pdf).
We can build [better solar
panels](http://theconversation.com/getting-more-energy-from-the-sun-how-to-make-better-solar-cells-54090)
to better capture the energy laid down upon the land[4]. All of
this forces us to constantly shift the asymptote limiting the growth
higher and higher. That's a big difference that the fish in the
pond don't have. This isn't to say growth is unlimited here on
Earth, but it can be pushed to higher and higher than, we could
have endured at points in the past.

Ultimately, there is a cap.  I just don't think it is around the
corner as generations before have predicted.
