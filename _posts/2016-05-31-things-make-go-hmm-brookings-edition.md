Brookings questions the value of [ban the box legislation](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2016/05/31-ban-the-box-does-more-harm-than-good-doleac?cid=00900015020149101US0001-0531) and includes this gem:

>  [E]mployers might prefer applicants with a college degree not because of what one learns in college but because earning that degree is correlated with greater motivation, intelligence, and diligence â€“ unobservable characteristics that make you a more productive employee.
