Like all good parents, I took the kids to see _The Martian_ this afternoon.  It was awesome, but that's not the point.  The first 15 minutes or so are legitimately scary, especially as Mark Watney (Matt Damon) performed an operation on himself.  This still doesn't do it justice, it was kind of graphic.

Ducky, 3, spent this part of the movie with her head buried in my shoulder.  To help her out, I whispered in her ear, the scary parts were over and it was about to get awesome.  She whispered back, "Is he going to build a space robot."  And I said, "Yes, that's exactly what will happen next."

Then, loud enough for the entire theater, she yelled, "I LOVE SPACE ROBOTS!"
