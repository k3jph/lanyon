As promised, I've [posted the syllabus for Foundations of Research
Methods in Administration](/assets/docs/MSA600-Syllabus-Spring2017.pdf).
This course is a generic research methods course, though it is set
in the MSA context.  As a result, it should look like a research
methods course in just about any social science curriculum.

One of the more regrettable things is that I am not taking any big
risks in this course.  When [teaching public affairs](/teaching
public affairs), I got to develop some innovative methods and pushed
hard to create an inverted classroom format.  However, the class
format for MSA 600 is Friday evening followed by a full-day Saturday
session, every two weeks for five weeks.  I am not sure how to do
something interesting in such as constrained classroom format yet,
and I'd like to work it through once just to get a feel.
