Henry's law constant (HLC) for a given chemical is the [concentration
of a chemical in air / concentration of a chemical in
water](http://www.chemsafetypro.com/Topics/CRA/Henry_Law_Constant.html)
under defined test circumstances.  That is interesting, but the
important part is that it also describes the volatility of a chemical.
The more volatile a chemical is, the more likely it is to vaporize
into the air.  We've all heard the term [volatile organic compounds
(VOCs)](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds),
which includes gasoline and [tetrachloroethylene, sometimes used
in dry
cleaning](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/tetrachloroethylene.pdf).
Those VOCs are those that easily and quickly disperse into the air.

But dispersion also affects the environmental fate of the chemical.
The higher the HLC value, the more volatile it is, and the more it
will spread.  This makes cleaning up chemical spills more difficult.
In the inverse, the lower the HLC, the more it will stay in water
and will probably be adsorbed and broken down in soils.  This is
important because in a [2001 paper, Staudinger and
Roberts](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653500005051)
found that in general, the HLC value doubles for every 10 degree
Celsius increase in ambient temperature.

If the temperature were fixed, this is a non-issue.  However, we
know that we are facing a [2 degree
Celsius](http://www.wri.org/ipcc-infographics) global temperature
increase by 2100, a number that is right now a best case scenario
if the world starts limiting carbon production.  Other scenarios
can be as [high as 6.4 degrees
Celsius](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html).
Given an exponential relationship between HLC and temperature, that
implies the _effective_ environmental HLC will increase at least
20 percent over current values.  Perhaps more.  That will increase
the dispersion rate into and many chemicals will spread further
than they already do.

Global climate change has a lot of negative consequences, but one
of the more interesting is that it will make handling unrelated
environmental problems much worse.
