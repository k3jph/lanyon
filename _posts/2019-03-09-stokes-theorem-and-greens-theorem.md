I took a look at [Green's
theorem](/2019/03/04/greens-theorem-and-the-planimeter/) last week
and its relationship to the planimeter. Green's theorem is a
remarkable work that tells us much about the structure of two-dimensional
shapes. As I said, it's analogous to the [fundamental theorem of
calculus](https://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/fundamental_thm/),
finding the area under the curve.

But Green's theorem only works in two dimensions. And that's a bit
of a downer. Fortunately, there's [Stoke's
theorem](https://mathinsight.org/stokes_theorem_examples). Stoke's
theorem gives us everything. It goes to three dimensions! It goes
to four! But wait, there's more. It completely generalizes both the
fundamental theorem of calculus and Green's theorem. Formally,
[Wikipedia states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem)
it more succinctly than I can, "Stokes' theorem says that the
integral of a differential form ω over the boundary of some orientable
manifold Ω is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative dω
over the whole of Ω." It means you can find the area enclosed by
any shape in any number of dimensions from the line, and vice-versa.

What's remarkable about both of these theorems is the role the [Lord
Kelvin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/kelvin_lord.shtml)
played in each. The Lord Kelvin is more commonly known for finding
the limit of absolute cold and the Kelvin temperature unit is named
for him. But like all great scientists, he solved problems he saw
and found a form of Green's theorem that Stokes generalized into
what is now called the Stokes' theorem.

What's interesting about this is that Kelvin's interim result was
communicated by letter, not by journal article. At the time, this
was not uncommon. While academic journals existed, these letters
were a common method for transmitting ideas from scientist-to-scientist.
It's fortunate today that we still have so many of these letters
and can retrospectively track the evolution of the idea.
