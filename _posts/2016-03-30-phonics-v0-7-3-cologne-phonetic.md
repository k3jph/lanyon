Version 0.7.3 of the [Phonics](/software/phonics) software package posted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phonics) overnight.  This new version includes support for the Cologne (KÃ¶lner) phonetic spelling algorithm.  Cologne had been in for about a month, but this is the first release including it.  As always, you can report bugs [via GitHub](https://github.com/howardjp/phonics/issues).
