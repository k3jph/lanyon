Here's a great article on export credit.  Following the fight over the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which I discussed [here in 2014](https://jameshoward.us/2014/07/03/reauthorizing-ex-im-bank/), [here in 2015](https://jameshoward.us/2015/05/10/economic-effects-of-the-ex-im-bank/), [here again in 2015](https://jameshoward.us/2015/06/23/cbos-analysis-ex-im-bank/), and [in _The Conversation_ last year](https://jameshoward.us/2015/06/23/dont-let-the-ex-im-bank-expire/), the bank was reauthorized by Congress after a brief shutdown period.  Elaine Pofeldt has a good article in _Global Trade_ where she discussed Ex-Im, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and other export finance options.

Predictably, I make an appearance discussing political risk.  You can get the full article on _Global Trade_'s website:
