I have two book reviews in the current issue of the [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org).  First, I reviewed _[Data-Driven Modeling & Scientific Computation: Methods for Complex
Systems & Big Data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067b01)_ by J. Nathan Kutz.

From the review,

> Unlike other scientific computing books, Kutz also takes on the broader topic of data science methods. The author, in his introduction, states two goals for his text. First, the text should be suitable for advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate instruction. Second, the book should be usable as a reference text for practitioners. Kutz divides the text into four parts, really representing two fields.
