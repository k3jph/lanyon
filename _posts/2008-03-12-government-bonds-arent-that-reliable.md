[Cate Long blogs a story](http://shopyield.com/blog/2008/03/11/ratings-equivalence) about how local governments are looking for a more favorable bond rating.  In short, municipalities are held to a higher standard.  Yesterday's [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-bonds11mar11,0,1211017.story) echoed this sentiment, as states demand ratings reflecting their financial position.  In recent years, bond issuers would purchase insurance from highly rated insurers to guarantee an issuance with a AAA rating.  But with bond insurers ratings being cut, municipalities want off the hook and a higher rating.

They shouldn't be.  Governments have a tendency to respond to popular demands rather than sound financial wisdom.  When push comes to shove, elected officials will fold quicker than a private concern to popular demands for income cuts and expense increases.  The Federal government exemplifies this behavior and it is a form of political risk that private concerns are simply not subject to.  As a result, municipalities, states, and sovereigns do need to be held to a higher standard.
