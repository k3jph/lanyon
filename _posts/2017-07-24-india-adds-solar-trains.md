Last year, Chase asked me about solar-powered trains, and we did
the analysis.  Like a good little nerd, I posted the analysis here:

It turns out, Indian Railways has been working on the same problem.
Now, my analysis was predicated on the assumption that all of the
energy necessary to power the train would come from solar.  Indian
Railways has split the difference and started putting [solar panels
on passenger
cars](http://sustainabilitynext.in/news/solar-power-systems-on-roofs-of-500-trains)
to power the air conditioning, lighting, and other passenger
amenities.

It doesn't solve the problem of burning fuel as diesel is still
used to move the train, but diesel will no longer be necessary to
generate power for the amenities.  Indian Railways estimates this
will save 21,000 L of diesel per year.  In addition, Indian Railways
is adding solar panels to its stations that can generate 1 GW of
power over the next five years.

As rail and telecommunications companies own or control a massive
amount of land in the United States, through rights-of-way, there's
an opportunity here to use that land for power generation, either
for hyper-local use (powering a sign, often seen on highways), or
additional revenue generation.

on many different stories about this innovation._
