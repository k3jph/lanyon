For reasons too complicated to get into, I am taking a course in
environmental chemistry.  And that means I will be writing about
it occasionally here.  Because that's the kind of thing I do.

Acrylamide (ACR) is a common hydrocarbon used in industrial settings
and found in some foods [fried at high
temperatures](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb09641.x/abstract)
as well as [some
fruits](http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/archive_articles/070920-acrylamid/index_EN.html).
Industrially, ACR is used to manufacture some plastics and is also
used in [the wastewater treatment
process](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+9003-05-8).
ACR is also a known neurotoxicant causing [peripheral
neuropathy](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-139/pdfs/2011-139.pdf).

The exact mechanism of ACR on neurological systems is unknown, but
some have suggested that ACR interferes with certain neurotransmitters.
In other words, it blocks the signal from the brain to muscular
control. 
[LoPachin, et al,](https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/95/1/136/1690176/Structure-Toxicity-Analysis-of-Type-2-Alkenes-In)
investigated how this interference may occur because ACR has many
beneficial uses and better understanding may lead to the development
of nontoxic alternatives.

ACR is a conjugated type-2 alkene, meaning it is an alkene, a class
of hydrocarbons, with an electrophilic group attached to one of the
alkene's carbons.  These electrophilic groups have been shown to
for adducts with certain neurotransmitters, so the mechanism suggested
above makes sense.  In the LoPachin paper, the authors looked at
different alkenes with the same electrophilic groups and related
nonconjugated chemicals, without the electrophilic group attached.
The authors measured the effects of exposure on _in vitro_ rat
populations.  From this study, the authors found that conjugated
alkenes showed the same neurotoxicity whereas nonconjugated alkenes
did not.  This clarifies the link between the electrophilic group
structure and neurotoxicity.

All of this is important because it can lead to the development of
"designer" chemicals, chemicals with the positive uses outlined at
the start of this post without the negative effects.  Of course,
those developed may not be without their own negative side effects.
However, this potential development would allow for safer industrial
processes, important for both the workers in those facilities and
those exposed to harmful emissions outside.
