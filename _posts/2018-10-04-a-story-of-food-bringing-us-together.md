Years ago, I worked for a small telecommunications company located
in Rockville, called [Startec Communications](http://www.startec.com).
Startec provided (maybe still does, who knows?) long distance
services targetting the immigrant community.  This was cheap long
distance and often poor quality connections.  Considering how easy
it is to get someone on the phone anywhere today, this may seem
strange.

Anyway, because we targetted the immigrant community in the United
States, we had to also _service_  that community.  So our call
center, located right there in Rockville, spoke 30-odd languages.
And many of those people were native speakers.
 And beyond the call center, the employees were a very diverse
 group.  Out of 600 employees, at the time, I was one of six white
 males.

So one day, I decided we'd have a cultural exchange.  Morale was
low.  It was the bottom of the [dot-com
bust](https://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes8.asp).  There
was a rather complete kitchen area just outside the call center,
so I sponsored and organized a giant potluck lunch.  The rule was,
you had to bring in something that represents your heritage.

It actually worked out very well.  As you might imagine, the cultural
differences sometimes manifested in difficulties in the office.  As
you might not imagine, some of the cultural conflicts I observed
seemed tied to much larger geopolitical conflicts.  I was an [IR
minor](https://scholars.umd.edu/programs/is) and still in college,
so maybe like the med student who diagnoses himself with each new
disease he learns of, I read too much into it.

But for a day, we all got together, enjoyed an incredible bounty
of delicious food from around the world, and so many people noticed
the similarities and subtle differences and for a day, everyone
seemed just a bit closer and just a bit more human.
