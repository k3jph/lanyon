The New York _Times_ has a magnificent story on the [inequities of
the pretrial diversion
systems](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/crime-criminal-justice-reform-diversion.html)
in use around the country.  Can we use this to estimate a defendant's
willingness to pay for pretrial diversion, subject to the constraints
of the budget curve?  Use this quote from the article:

> It is impossible to determine how many defendants are barred from
diversion for lack of money, but one jurisdiction offers a hint.
The diversion program in New Orleans once cost as much as $1,200
and had about 300 participants. In 2009, when a new district attorney
lowered the cost to $200, participation more than tripled.

Please justify your answer.
