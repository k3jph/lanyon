On Saturday, I discussed the ethics of [_The
Purge_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purge) on [Breakthrough
Entertainment](http://www.breakradioshow.com/show/breakthrough-entertainment/)
on [KPHX in Phoenix](http://www.1480kphx.com/). While _The Purge_
is a bad horror movie, some of the underlying ethical ideas exposed
raise some interesting questions. In addition, I discussed how some
of the ideas in _The Purge_ reflect the current political environment
and other historical parallels. I also talked about some antecedent
media that addressed these ideas including ["The Return of the
Archons"](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Archons_(episode)),
["The Lottery"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery), and
_[The Hunger
Games](http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/the_hunger_games_69765.htm)_.
