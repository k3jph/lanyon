I have another review in the _[Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/)_ on the book _Meta-Analysis with R_.  From the review,

> Meta-analysis is a set of analytical tools that allows us to collect multiple different results into what can be thought of as a weighted average of the individual studiesâ€™ results.

The book provides a solid introduction to meta-analysis using R.  You can read the whole review at JSS:

And purchase the book on Amazon here:
