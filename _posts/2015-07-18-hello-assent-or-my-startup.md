Last week, I posted about a start-up I worked for so many lives ago.  Tonight, I write what's coming next.  I posted a <a href="https://gust.com/companies/assentsystems">public profile to Gust</a>, the start up social network, for Assent Systems.  From our profile, this is what we are doing:

<blockquote>
  Assent Systems is creating next generation software licensing, management, and fulfillment tools. These tools enable independent software vendors to regulate usage of their products amongst end-user organizations, protecting their intellectual property and sales investments.
</blockquote>

In plain English, we are developing new systems for providing license control for independent software vendors.  This work is based on some experiences working with fulfillment software at the Fed.  But I didn't have everything I needed to make a superior alternative until recently.

Our status right now is different from the other startups.  While there is sample code, it doesn't do much and would never be included in a final product.  We don't have a Twitter account, or a Facebook page, or even a website yet.  I want to focus on the product and make it real, then make it look good.  But I did make a quick-and-dirty logo, and you can see it here on this page.

Right now, my next steps are pulling together patent applications for the handful of innovations that will make this thing work.  If you'd like to know more, you can check out the Gust site above or email me.
