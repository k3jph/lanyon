I think instructor presence is critical to student engagement, for all the obvious reasons.  I've occasionally had students connect with me on LinkedIn or Twitter, those are passive engagements.  I once, in a face-to-face class, had a student post on my Facebook wall, during class.[1.  Under the circumstances, it was entirely appropriate.  It was the last class before the exam and I had review material only.  Precisely two students came to class.  They suggested they should get extra credit.  I posted on Facebook that if anyone agreed they should get extra credit, I would grant it.  One of the two students hunted down the post and agreed.  I gave them extra credit.]

But part of the problem is maintaining active engagement.  I sometimes worry that students who are in online classes are there to reduce the active engagement requirement.  For instance, I used to do a weekly one-hour video chat, like a virtual office hours.  And I set it up so you could see it live if we were online.  Also, others could just click the button and join during class, if they wished.  Anyway, over like 4 semesters of doing this, I only have 3 students total show up.  It got frustrating, so I stopped eventually.

To an extent, the social media features inside the online classroom are self-defeating, since they are not always on, like Facebook and Twitter.  But as a society, we have decided it may not be appropriate to like/friend/follow our instructors and students.  It's kind of a catch 22.
