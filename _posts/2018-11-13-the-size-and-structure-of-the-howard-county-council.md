It's been a week since the election and we're all still digesting
the results, I think. Here in Howard County, things mostly slow
down. The next big things to happen in Howard County will be two
long term processes. First, after the Census, the County will
reapportion County Council seats, to keep the size of districts in
balance. This is the same process that the states go through for
both the United States House of Representatives and the state
legislatures.

Also, every eight years, the County automatically goes through
Charter review. This consists of a Charter Review Commission and
will be appointed in early 2019. I think we need to talk about the
Council during this Charter review cycle. Specifically, it needs
to grow.

I did a quick analysis and you can see the full analysis below. For
each county in Maryland, I collected the information on how big the
legislature was. This may be a commission or council led county,
but each county has different sizes and structures. Some may be
elected at large or by district. And some may be mixed, such as
Baltimore's districts with a city-wide council president. I collected
all the individual jurisdictions' legislature sizes, regardless of
structure, along with the 2010 Census count from the [Maryland
Archives](http://mdmanual.msa.maryland.gov/). The population has
changed around the state, but the amounts of that are not important
at this stage.

Based on this analysis, Howard County's five council members each
represent 57,417 people. The Maryland-wide average is about 33,038
per county legislature. Not only are Howard County's districts
unusually large, but the difference is statistically significant
($p = 0.001942$). Not only this, but the members of the Maryland
House of Delegates represent smaller populations. The number of
people per delegate is about 40,947, though some of those districts
are larger with multiple delegates.

How big the Council should be is another question. To reach the
state-wide average, Howard County would require 9 council members.
Maybe this is the right number, maybe not. Going to at least 7 seems
justifiable to keep the council closer to the people they are
representing. And it is also possible some of those members should
be elected county-wide. Perhaps 6 or 8 members plus a county-wide
elected Council president is the best approach.

The numbers don't tell us the best thing to do. But they do suggest
the forthcoming Charter Review Commission needs to seriously consider
the question.
