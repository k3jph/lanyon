This morning's Baltimore Sun [featured an article](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/howard/bal-ho.politics05apr05,0,4726958.story) on this year's CA election.  It is delightful to be called young.

Just to elaborate on some of the points in the article--I am running on six years of experience working with the CA and Long Reach.  This includes four years as Chair of the Financial Advisory and Budget committees and frequent volunteer consultant on economic, financial, and performance management issues to the Board and staff of the CA.  

As my wife often reminds me, I am a total math nerd.  I have spent a lot of time and energy developing analysis and metrics for the organization.  I plan to bring critical analysis and professionalism to CA as a member of the Columbia Council.  At the end of the day, I am goals oriented and results driven.  I use the tools and skills I have developed to accomplish specific things.  I care about Columbia and Columbia values--and that's the real reason I'm spending my time and energy on the CA.
