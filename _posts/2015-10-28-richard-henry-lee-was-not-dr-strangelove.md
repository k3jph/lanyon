Following last week's discussion of John Adams and _1776_, we made the kids listen to the soundtrack on a car trip over weekend.  Also, we used the [1997 revival](http://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/4754) with [Brent Spiner](http://www.therealbrentspiner.com/) as Adams.

During ["The Lees of Old Virginia,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlUYUTo4nlM) we stopped the recording to talk to Chase about Richard Henry Lee.  The musical portrays Lee as a buffoon, but he was really a great colonial leader.  We also talked to Chase about how his right hand had been injured, leading him to cover it with a black handkerchief.

I asked Chase if he knew of anyone else who covered an injured hand in black, thinking he'd say Luke Skywalker. Chase is a huge Star Wars fan.  He hits me with this:

> That guy in the movie with the guy who rode the bomb.

And after a beat, I realized, yes, [Dr. Strangelove](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) did do that!  I am totally winning at parenting.
