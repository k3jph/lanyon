One of the more interesting anaerobic processes is the breakdown
of municipal solid waste in landfills.  I grew up not far from what
we called [Rumpke
Mountain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3800+Struble+Rd,+Cincinnati,+OH+45251/@39.2651536,-84.6026085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88404a0ed3f323b3:0xa46b9ce5781dcccf!8m2!3d39.2651536!4d-84.6004198?hl=en),
the sixth largest landfill in the United States.  Landfills typically
require venting because [anaerobic processes consume the solid waste
within the
landfill](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas),
producing methane and carbon dioxide gasses.  If not vented properly,
the gas can build up causing an explosion.  Many have tried capturing
the gas during venting to make the methane usable.

I recently learned how landfill waste can be processed in a bioreactor.
Waste Management is working on testing new [bioreactor-based
landfills](http://www.wm.com/sustainability/bioreactor-landfills.jsp). In
a bioreactor landfill, the landfill will degrade organic materials
by increasing the moisture level of the waste.  Assorted microbes
consume the waste, basically composting the organic material.
Inorganic material is left behind, but it substantially cuts the
volume of the waste.  At this stage, WM is still looking into the
qualities of aerobic, anaerobic, aerobic-anaerobic, and facultative
processes to determine their relative effectiveness.

The neat thing here is that WM is trying to change the way landfills
work from, well, dumps, to "waste treatment" facilities.  In a
sense, this is a solid waste parallel to the wastewater stream.
From their perspective, they would eliminate the risks associated
with dumping raw waste into a landfill and the potential for leaks.
Further, WM is researching whether it is possible to retrofit
existing landfills to fit this model.

This is a great way to reduce the effective volume of solid waste
produced if it can be done effectively and at scale.
