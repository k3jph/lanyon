In a statement of blistering stupidity, [Leslie Stellman](http://pklaw.com/pk-law-directory/stellman-leslie-r/) claims the proposed school budget review committee violates state law.  From [the article](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-board-meeting-0616-20160610-story.html), Stellman reportedly told the Board of Education,

> The county's fiscal authority through an agency such as this creation would erode your immunity as a state agency.

This is obviously incorrect, since the the County Council is responsible for approving the budget of the school system, per [Maryland Education Article ยง 5-102](http://web.lexisnexis.com/research/xlink?app=00075&view=full&interface=1&docinfo=off&searchtype=get&search=Md.+EDUCATION+Code+Ann.+%A7+5-102).  The Board of Education has no immunity as a state agency to begin with, as sole fiscal responsibility for the school system lies with the Howard County Council.  There's a lot of beef to be had with the committee structure, but if the Council wishes to constitute an advisory board to support the exercise of its state-mandated duties, that is both the responsibility and prerogative of the Council.  

The School Board's objections to the bill are groundless and fundamentally antithetical to the democratic process.
