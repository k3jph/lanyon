[Interesting People links](http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/247/2008/20080215101442:C2B9FAF0-DBD8-11DC-90EB-DAD0189CFB26/) to an Apple Insider article on the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and [Google](http://www.google.com).  The summary is, Google is receiving a large number of search queries from iPhones and the question is whether other phone manufacturers should make the Internet more accessible.

I carry a [BlackBerry](http://www.blackberry.com) with me everywhere I go.  The BlackBerry is incredible at processing mail, but its browser is not standards compliant and barely functional on top of it.  Even with [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com), without [EDGE service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution), web browsing is still painfully slow.  [GPRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service) is just too slow.

But I still Google constantly from my phone.  I sometimes use the browser.  I sometimes use the [text 1="interface" language="messaging"][/text](http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/mobile/sms/).  Moving toward making the Internet, generally, more accessible from mobile devices will greatly increase the usage of it.  Google already [knows this](http://code.google.com/android/).

This will go further, when the distinction between the "Internet" and the "Mobile Internet" decreases.  For some time, I have maintained a handheld-ready diminutive version of this site.  With the last style change, I have stopped as Opera and the iPhone make displaying real web sites on mobile devices a reality.  The more like the real web a phone is, the better will be the user experience.
