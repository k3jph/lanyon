Plain form versus formal form of the language is something Americans
do not think they do. Except, they do differentiate between formal
and informal language. Sociolinguists call this
[register](https://drsaraheaton.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/language-register-and-why-it-matters-or-why-you-cant-write-an-academic-paper-in-gangsta-slang/),
when we change the style of speech we use in different contexts.

For instance, if I am writing an essay for class, I use a more
formal register. Accordingly, I use proper grammar and ensure my
spelling is correct. There is an appropriate level of formality.

On the other hand, I might respond to my children with "whatevs"
when they ask me a question or maybe just have a conversation
entirely in _Star Wars_ quotes. Actually, I used to do that in my
last job. And one of the other employees routinely addressed me as
Lord Vader.

The point is, we split our language in different ways to convey
meaning in different ways. Here's a delightful video summarizing
the five key registers:

Now, this is not quite the same as the concept of [code
switching](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/13/177126294/five-reasons-why-people-code-switch).
In code switching, we change how we communicate without an associated
change in context.

So, now that we understand the concept of linguistic registers, we
can see that we switch between different registers and while we
mostly know how to do it, there are very few formal rules. In fact,
one of the most interesting examples comes from the [Wikipedia page
on register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)):

> Examples might include pronouncing words ending in -ing with a
velar nasal instead of an alveolar nasal (e.g. "walking", not
"walkin'"), choosing words that are considered more "formal" (such
as father vs. dad, or child vs. kid), and refraining from using
words considered nonstandard, such as ain't.

Specifically, child versus kid and father versus dad are not defined
as being formal versus informal. But we mostly feel, somewhat
instinctively, that is a correct assessment. Now, many languages
include defined formal and informal language elements. We see this
in Spanish, for instance.

We also see this in Japanese. In Japanese, we have short form verbs
for "informal" language. But this is nothing more than the register
change we see in every other language. It is just that as English
speakers, we do not see ourselves doing it as frequently without
the formal rules.
