I talked about the [Outer Space
Treaty](/2017/08/18/note-outer-space-treaty/) a couple of days ago
and I would like to expand upon the theme by discussing the Moon
Treaty, formally known as the "Agreement Governing the Activities
of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies."  [The Moon Treaty
was adopted in
1979](https://academic.oup.com/clp/article-abstract/33/1/213/375978), and
provided some additional restrictions on how celestial bodies could
be used.  In this treaty, all celestial bodies in the Solar System
are included in the terms, with special terms of use provided for
the Moon.

While the Moon Treaty applied to the entire Solar System, except
Earth, there were special provides provided for the Moon.  In the
treaty, the Moon is declared "The Moon and its natural resources
are the common heritage of mankind."  The same language is used in
the Law of the Sea, [adopted a few years
earlier](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40706663), and is generally
agreed to mean that the private exploitation of the seabed is
prohibited.  Accordingly, this provision was meant to preclude the
private exploitation of the Moon and its resources for commercial
purposes.  In addition, the language is meant to prohibit the
military use of those resources, intending that peaceful use is
permissible.

The Moon Treaty also explicitly called out that the militarization
of the Moon was prohibited.  The Moon Treaty expands the Outer Space
Treaty's ban on militarization to further prohibit [weapons testing,
fortifications, and other installations on the
Moon](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002234338302000406).  The
Treaty further states the Moon may only be used for "peaceful
purposes."  This is in the context of the existing use of space,
which was initially developed for military purposes.  Both the
United States's and Soviet Union's space programs originated from
within each nation's respective military programs.

Finally, the Moon Treaty disallows any nation from claiming any
part of the Moon, surface or subsurface, as part of its sovereign
territory.  Nations are allowed to establish posts and bases, but
it does not [entitle them to a right of
ownership](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mistjintl3&div=29&g_sent=1&collection=journals)
to any part of the lunar body.  Effectively abolishing any sense
of private property rights, the resources of the Moon must be
available for all and resources must be shared.  One discovering a
new resource, like a wildcat speculator, would be unable to lay a
claim to the resource.

Together, the restrictions of the Moon Treaty could disincentivize
any viable national or commercial use of outer space and celestial
bodies.  But while the restrictions are more imposing than those
outlined in the Outer Space Treaty, the Moon Treaty has essentially
no effect.  Only a [handful of nations have ratified their ascension
to the Moon Treaty](http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1954/1)
and none of them have their own launch capability combined with
manned space program.  Those countries with launch capability,
include the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and the larger
European Union countries have not acceded to the Moon Treaty,
effectively killing it.  While, at any time, any launch-capable
nation may choose to join the treaty, it is unlikely due to the
restrictions it would place on commercial exploitation of discoveries
and resources acquired in exploration.

The Moon Treaty may be a failed treaty, but in context, it is
inapplicable, anyway.  Coming into effect more than ten years after
the last human left the Moon, there's been no use for the treaty.
But some hope that as applications of space exploration, especially
private exploration, will lead to a reimagined Moon Treaty to
encourage the reasonable use of space resources.  For instance, one
author [imagines the discovery of water could lead greater support
for private property
rights](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/gintenlr11&div=29&id=&page=&collection=journals)
on the Moon and other celestial bodies.  On the other hand, another
[hopes for a "kindler, gentler" treaty for the
Moon](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jnatrenvl8&div=21&id=&page=&collection=journals),
designed to alleviate the risks of space colonialism.
