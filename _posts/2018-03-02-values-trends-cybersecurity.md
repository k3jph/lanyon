Working with [Natalie Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com) at
Towson, [Paul
Goethals](https://www.usma.edu/math/_layouts/wpFacultyBios/DisplayBio.aspx?ID=b65ee913-e572-4d32-9474-9bf372c143ae&List=1ebd54dc-d44d-4834-8add-2da90afb21f5)
at West Point, and I, Towson student Lorraine Black reviewed survey
data from small law firms and IT professionals to investigate values
and attitudes toward cybersecurity.

I had only a small role with the statistical analysis, but the paper
will be presented at the [Institute of Industrial and Systems
Engineers Annual Conference](http://www.iise.org/Annual/) in Orlando
in May.  Here's a brief description:

> We survey information technology professionals as well as small
legal firms and solo practitioners to understand what they value
in a secure cyber system.  We identify differences in values between
the two populations as well as how a previous attack or breach can
affect value.  Finally, we provide an inventory of values, as
identified by the survey respondents, which can be inputs to a value
model.
