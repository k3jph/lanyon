According to [this Politico article](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/whats-next-for-ex-im-as-time-runs-out-119488.html), House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling has released a statement saying the Ex-Im Bank windup is expected to take between 12 and 18 years.  This is because the terms of financing on previously issued policies extend them out that far.  During this time, Ex-Im Bank will be a zombie agency.  Not alive, but not quite dead, either.
