On the way back from [INFORMS 2019 in
Seattle](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2019/), I
met Ashley Smith and Ashley Kilgore from INFORMS on the plane. After
talking a bit, Ashley Kilgore asked me if I'd be on the [Resoundingly
Human Podcast](https://pubsonline.informs.org/magazine/orms-today/podcasts)
to talk about applications of data science. Ashley really wanted
to talk about one of my first projects at [APL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), and that was our
study of [restaurant health code
violations](https://jameshoward.us/2017/03/03/data-science-restaurant-inspections/).

We had a great talk. You can listen to it on the [INFORMS
website](https://pubsonline.informs.org/magazine/orms-today/podcasts) or
below to learn more about what can place a restaurant at risk for
being a health hazard and how can we help public health officials
respond faster.

After this, Ashley and I had a long and detailed discussion about
ducks and [James Veitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5d8pVg3Qtg).
Really.
