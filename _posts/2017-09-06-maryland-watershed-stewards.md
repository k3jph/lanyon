I was recently appointed to the [Howard County Watershed Stewards
Academy](http://www.howardwsa.org/)'s Advisory Committee and yesterday
was my first meeting.  I wanted to take a minute and discuss this
program and the value it adds to the community.

As I have talked about before,
most of Maryland's land drains into the Chesapeake Bay.  Accordingly,
it is important that our streams and waterways that drain into the
bay are clean and healthy.  If not, it can lead to fish kills and
[eutrophication](/2017/07/10/eutrophication-reduction-local-limits/).  And
that's if we don't just turn the Bay into [hazardous
waste](http://www.environmentalcouncil.org/priorities/article.php?x=264).
The Watershed Stewards are volunteers who help protect the Bay,
ensuring the survival of this natural resource.

The Watershed Stewards program is actually run out of the [University
of Maryland
Extension](https://extension.umd.edu/watershed/watershed-stewards-academy)
providing local training in about six Maryland counties.  The
training teaches Master Watershed Stewards how to infiltrate
stormwater at the source, reduce pollutants in local waterways, and
other actions that can increase the quality of the Chesapeake Bay.
Meeting one day a week for about four months, the certification
program provides everyone with the fundamentals of watershed
management.
