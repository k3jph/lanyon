* Ivana Pecháčková, _The Legend of the Golem_, trans. Klára Tvarůžková, Second, The Legends of Prague (Prague, ČR: Meander, 2004). 

Pecháčková retells the story of the [Golem of Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem) from the perspective of a Heidelberg student, Johan, who is obsessed with finding the Golem and using it for his own ends. Johan’s story takes him with a traveling theater company, into Emperor Rudolph court, and ultimately to the [Old New Synagogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_New_Synagogue).

The book is beautifully illustrated with pencil drawings by Petr Nikl and makes an excellent children’s book (though not for younger children). The book is the second in a series of books called “The Legends of Prague,” which also cover the [Infant of Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_of_Prague), the [Astronomical Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Astronomical_Clock), the [Charles Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge), and the [Loreta Bells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreta).
