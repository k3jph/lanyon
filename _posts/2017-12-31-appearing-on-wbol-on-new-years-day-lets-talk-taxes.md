Good news everyone!  Spend New Year's Day listening to me to talk
about the effects of the [new tax
bill](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/15/us/politics/final-republican-tax-bill-cuts.html),
especially on Baltimore and its residents.  I'll be on [Patrick
Hendersonâ€™s _Meet the
People_](https://wolbbaltimore.com/schedule/patrick-hendersons-meet-the-people/)
from 11:30 to 1:00pm EST on [WBOL](https://wolbbaltimore.com/).
You can listen to the broadcast live on their website:

This tax bill is going to have many effects broadly across the
economy.  We will see impacts in lower income communities as funds
dry up to pay for essential services.  And we will see middle-class
communities fall apart when their schools' funding is no longer
deductible.  Over the last several decades, the Federal tax code
has sat at the fulcrum of a delicate balance of many different
interests.  The wrecking ball of the 2017 Tax Act will change the
relationship state and local governments have with both the Federal
government and their citizens.  It's going to be a wild ride.
