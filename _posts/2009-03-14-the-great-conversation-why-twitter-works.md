This morning's FT had [an article on free applications for the BlackBerry](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/66d84d14-0f70-11de-ba10-0000779fd2ac.html) which mentioned Viigo.  Still on [the bus](http://www.mtamaryland.com), I downloaded one, [Viigo](http://www.viigo.com).  Kind of disappointed after a few minutes, I twittered [Viigo not has nice as Financial Times reports](http://twitter.com/howardjp/status/1321190835) (note to self, learn to spell).

Moments later, the CEO of Viigo. Mark Ruddock, replied:  [@howardjp what were your concerns? We'd love to know.](http://twitter.com/RuddockMH/status/1321250658)  I don't know if my concerns are valid yet, but you have to give credit to Mr. Ruddock for following up so quickly and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) for making it possible.  

The lesson here is about the Great Conversation.  Because technology really has made [the world flat](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat), it is easier to get access to those with the power to change things.  Whether it is the company boss, your [member of Congress](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Members_of_Congress_who_Twitter), or the [First Lord of the Treasury](http://twitter.com/DowningStreet), the nature (and maybe the contents) of the discussion has changed, and is one step closer to be bidirectional.

I am [not the first person to notice this](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_get_customer_service_via_twitter.php).  But most likely, I will give Viigo a second try.
