[NPR has made a lot out of a report that insurance companies made $400 million in profit](http://www.npr.org/2016/05/24/478868270/business-of-disaster-insurance-firms-profited-400-million-after-sandy) from flood insurance.  This does not seem likely.

When [I wrote my text on flood insurance](/se-nfip), I was unable to disaggregate profit numbers.  Also, some of the figures given in the NPR report are simply incorrect.  For instance, they show that 1/3 of premiums go to insurances companies.  Insurance companies receive 15% to manage record keeping, sales, and claims processing.  In addition, companies that sell well get up to 2% more, capping the amount insurance companies are paid at half of the 1/3rd given by NPR.  Contrary to report's tone, this is not free money.  Insurance companies do quite a bit to work for it.

When I asked NPR on Twitter how they how they got the $400M number several days ago, I received no response.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just heard this on radio. How did you calculate $400M?</p>&mdash; Dr. James Howard (@k3jph) <a href="https://twitter.com/k3jph/status/735214956212322304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Absent substantial data and explanation, $400M is a little hard to swallow.
