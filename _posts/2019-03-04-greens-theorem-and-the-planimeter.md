I am going to start by saying I do not find [Green's
theorem](https://mathinsight.org/greens_theorem_idea) very intuitive.
It is a magnificently powerful theorem. It has been proven, so it
must be true, but unlike many other theorems, I do not feel it comes
naturally. (I have [mentioned this
before](https://jameshoward.us/2015/10/04/stop-being-so-irrational/)!) But
I think that is because it does not start with our normal
[latex]x[/latex]-[latex]y[/latex] Cartesian plane.

There is a really good discussion of this on the [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem/greens-theorem-articles/a/greens-theorem)
website, which is the best explanation I have seen. The gist of it
is that the relationship of a closed curve to the area it encloses
is analogous to the [relationship of a curve and the area beneath
that curve from freshman
calculus](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremsofCalculus.html).
Having such a relationship is powerful because we can use it to
find the area enclosed in any two-dimensional shape using a calculation
on the length of the line around it.

That is where the planimeter comes in. The planimeter is a device
to measure the line circumscribing a shape. It also performs the
calculation. The process is beautiful to watch and you can see an
example here:
