Adam Gopnik has a strange essay in _The New Yorker_, suggesting
that the confluence of unusual events confirms the simulation
hypothesis.  Specifically, the results from the Oscars, the Super
Bowl, and 2016 Election confirm a "glitch in the matrix" has occurred:

{% include iframely.html url="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/did-the-oscars-just-prove-that-we-are-living-in-a-computer-simulation" %}

The simulation hypothesis was first given by Hans Moravec and was
expanded by philosophy nerd [Nick
Bostrom](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2F1467-9213.00309).  Bostrom
states, simply, that sufficiently advanced societies will be
interested in running "ancestor simulations" to model historical
and current behavior.  The goal is to better understand how and why
things happen.  The argument itself is anthropological since this
is something we do.  Our models are simpler, but grow more complex
and realistic at each iteration.

The statistical argument is that a sufficiently advanced society
will run multiple simulations and we are statistically more likely
to be in a simulation than the original society.

> The result, bizarre on the surface—with that unprecedented and
impossible comeback complete with razzle-dazzle catches and completely
blown coverages and defensive breakdowns—makes no sense at all in
the “real” world. Doesn’t happen. But it is exactly what you expect
to happen when a teen-ager and his middle-aged father exchange
controllers in the EA Sports video-game version: the father stabs
and pushes the buttons desperately while the kid makes one play
after another, and twenty-five-point leads are erased in minutes,
and in just that way—with ridiculous ease on the one side and
chicken-with-its-head-cut-off panic infecting the other.

This is absurd, since scientists do not generally run simulations
just to mess with them.  That's what a kid playing the _The Sims_
does.  Which leads me to a revised theory.  We are in a bad video
game.

My mother was ahead of the curve on this one.  Whenever something
would go wrong, she used to say, "It could be worse.  It could all
be real."
