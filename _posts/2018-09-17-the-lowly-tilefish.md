Here in Maryland, we often think of the blue crab as our major
seafood.  But the best part of Maryland, if you love seafood, is
its incredible variety.  And more frequently, the fish on the menu
is
[tilefish](https://www.seafoodsource.com/seafood-handbook/finfish/tilefish).
The tilefish is found in the North Atlantic from Nova Scotia to
Florida and there's a plan to prevent overfishing.  The [Mid-Atlantic
Fishery Management Council](http://www.mafmc.org) (MAFMC) is the
Federally-sponsored organization that provides fisheries management
from New York to North Carolina.  And they protect the tilefish,
ensuring its here for generations.

Of course, there are different ways of approaching this.  There's
the [Gordon Schaefer
Model](http://rlhick.people.wm.edu/posts/gordon-shaefer-model.html), which
assumes the population is subject to a [sigmoid
function](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SigmoidFunction.html).  But
more commonly, the [maximum sustainable
yield](https://oceana.org/blog/ask-dr-pauly-what-maximum-sustainable-yield)
(MSY) is the bioeconomic model used by fisheries.  The MAFMC uses
MSY to manage the tilefish population.

The MSY presumes that there are enough members of the population
reproducing to continue producing enough members for the next
generation.  At the same time, there are natural (e.g., nonfishing)
limits to the population from resource scarcity and predation.  The
MSY varies from species to species and population to population
based on maturation and predation rates.

In 2000, the MAFMC found the tilefish population was around 35% of
the MSY level and instituted a new fishery management plan for
golden tilefish, later adding the blueline tilefish in 2017.  The
MAFMC uses a tiered commercial quota and a separate individual
fishing quota for golden tilefish.  The MAFMC [claims success
noting](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/511cdc7fe4b00307a2628ac6/t/5a81d98224a6943ee889c865/1518459267649/Tilefish+AP+Info+February+10+2018.pdf):

> Golden tilefish was under a stock rebuilding strategy beginning
in 2001 until it was declared rebuilt in 2014.

The golden tilefish is not considered overfished and the stock
appears to be sustainable.

The blueline tilefish rebuilding has just begun and there are no
results yet.  Right now, the blueline tilefish is considered
overfished in the MAFMC's jurisdiction and the management plan,
less than a year old, will likely take years to prove successful.

The MAFMC has an [extensive webpage about the tilefish management
plans](http://www.mafmc.org/tilefish/).  Further, the MAFMC is
transparent and maintains extensive information about fisheries
management on their page.
