So I have been elected Chairperson of the [Board of Appeals for
Howard
County](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals).  I
have a bit of a [web page describing the things the Board of
Appeals](/service) does, and why you should care about
it.  Most of our work deals with reviewing conditional use zoning
applications, though a few other matters can come up, too.  I've
been chairman for a couple of terms, but last year [Steve Hunt took
over the role](http://stevehunt4hoco.com/).

We also elected [Neveen Kurtom](http://www.mymarylandattorney.com/)
as the vice chairperson.  She's a lawyer and we usually have one
or two on the Board at any given time.  Also, [we still have an
opening](/county-council-seeks-new-member-board-appeals), if you
are interested and want to know more, [let me know](/contact-me)
and I can fill you in on all the nitty-gritty details.
