Hey everyone, I am pleased to announce that [Bill
Woodcock](http://53beersontap.typepad.com/) and I are launching our
current affairs Internet show, [Do It
Live!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXRrLoN9hTDBKIJNz-VfCw)
this Sunday at 7pm, EST.  This has been in the works for more than
a year and we are very happy to bring it to you now.  As the name
suggests, we are doing it live.  No scripts, no rehearsals, and no
editing.  We are bringing it live from our mouthholes to your
earholes through a series of tubes!

You can watch it here starting at 7pm on December 11th:
