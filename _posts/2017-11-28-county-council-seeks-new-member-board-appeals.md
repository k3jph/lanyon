As I've said before, I don't often talk about land use.  But here's
a bit of news.  The Board of Appeals has an opening and the County
Council has [put out a call for
applications](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Portals/0/Documents/CouncilMain/Press%20Releases/2017/Board%20of%20Appeals%20Vacancy%20Press%20Release-11-28-17.pdf).
Short version of the details is that you should apply by December
15th.

The Board of Appeals has two roles in Howard County.  In the first
role, cases for [conditional
uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-use_permit), sometimes
called special use permits, are heard by the Board of Appeals Hearing
Examiner.  Under some circumstances, parties may appeal a decision
of the Hearing Examiner and the case will then be heard by the Board
of Appeals.  When the case is heard by the Board of Appeals, the
testimony and evidence are presented again, by all sides (there may
be more than two), and the Board of Appeals makes a decision.  A
similar process is followed for
[variances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).

In the second role, the Board of Appeals will hear cases as an
appellate body.  In these cases, a decision of some county agency
is brought to the Board of Appeals for review.  There are numerous
routes laid out in the [Howard County
Code](https://www.municode.com/library/md/howard_county) for an
appeal to be brought to the Board, and some are heard by the Hearing
Examiner before the Board.  In the last five years, the overwhelming
majority of these were land-use cases originating from a decision
of the Department of Planning and Zoning, such as code enforcement
decisions, and cases from the Howard County Planning Board, which
is authorized to approve development plans based on the Zoning
Regulations.

If you're interested and want to know more before applying, let me
know and we'll set up a time to talk about the Board of Appeals.
