The [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/) has deployed their new website, updated a style used for about five years.  It doesn't deliver the types of Web 2.0 features you might like to see, but they do categorize and list the University-hosed blogs, wikis, and other chewy toys on the main page.  Information is presented much more logically, and that makes a large institution easier to navigate.

On a related note, you can now watch UMTV, the University's cable television station online at [http://www.umtv.umd.edu/](http://www.umtv.umd.edu/).  As I write this, they are broadcasting Deutsche Welle.  I wonder if anyone carries France 24.
