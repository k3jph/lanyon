Rochester Institute of Technology student [J.D. Harper](http://jdharper.info/) has written a new master's thesis on how to retrofit structures in dense urban areas for greater flood resistance.  Following Sandy's damage across the dense northeastern United States, it was clear standard retrofitting that was used across the less dense southeast would not work.  From the abstract:

> Through this investigation, a methodology was developed to evaluate the existing retrofitting flood-resilient strategies appropriate for dense urban areas. The methodology was then tested by applying the strategies to a case study building. The results of the application determined gaps in the current knowledge and provided information to propose recommendations for future research.
