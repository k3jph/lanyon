There is an interesting story of social change during the Meiji
Restoration of how Shinto was forced, by circumstance, to change.
During the Meiji period, from 1868 to 1912, the fundamental
relationship between the Japanese state and Shinto establishment
changed. In fact, while Buddhism had long held a [privileged place
in Japanese
society](https://brill.com/view/journals/jrj/1/1/article-p37_4.xml?language=en),
the Meiji period brought Shinto to a de facto state religion, though
the Japanese would [not have considered Shinto a
religion](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MADlfH002mAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA252&dq=Shinto+as+a+%E2%80%9CNon-religion%E2%80%9D&ots=0Z7YphAoZ0&sig=NnDMuteb_jrQbQ-oDo0gvpqHnjg#v=onepage&q=Shinto%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9CNon-religion%E2%80%9D&f=false)
in the Western sense.

One key step of modernization was the separation of Buddhism from
Shinto. Before the Meiji, Shinto and Buddhist practices were
intertwined, [both historically and
philosophically](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30233721). Further,
Shinto-Buddhist syncretism is a standard reference case in the
[study of
syncretism](https://jameshoward.us/2019/03/02/context-of-japanese-syncretism/).
The separation started with a governmental order to [separate the
deities](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062445?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
of the two religious traditions. Once that separation of deities
occured, the practices were able to standalone.

This separation allowed the Japanese state to provide [material
support to Shinto shrines](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30233855)
throughout Japan. This material support enabled Imperial power in
Japan by projecting the image "[of a great familial nation presided
over by the emperor, the supreme
father-figure](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30234430)." Of course,
the idea that religion would support a governing power structure
is hardly new, and is a central tenet of Confucianism, itself a
[major influence on pre-Meiji Japanese
thought](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718919). During and before
the Tokugawa period, Japanese leaders used Buddhism to support the
governing power structure.

Together, these changes to Shinto helped maintain a degree of social
stability during this period of greater social change.
