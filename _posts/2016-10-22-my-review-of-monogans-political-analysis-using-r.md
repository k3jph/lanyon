The _Journal of Statistical Software_ has published another review
I wrote, this time of Monogan's [_Political Analysis Using 
R_](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v074b01).
The book is a solid choice for a primary or supplementary text in
a political or policy methodology class, at the level of advanced
undergraduate or first-year graduate student.  You can get more
information from Springer's website:
