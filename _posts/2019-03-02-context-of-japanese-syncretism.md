For those of us brought up in a [traditional Western
society](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/western_culture.htm),
religion is well-defined. It is a [core belief
system](https://www.mrdowling.com/605westr.html) that includes some
sort of god or gods and some sort of moral code or direction. A key
feature of these religions is that one cannot be a member of more
than one. The belief structures contradict each other, despite the
obvious similarities. We traditionally associate the [Abrahamic
religions](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Abrahamic_religions)
with Western civilization, but the
[Greco-Roman](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_religion)
and [Teutonic](http://piereligion.org/germanic.html) religions also
pretty well met this definition, too.

Japan presents a conundrum when looking at religion because that
which we call religion really is not the same was what we see in
the West. The dominant religions in Japan are
[Shinto](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2056.html) and
[Buddhism](https://www.buddhanet.net/nippon/nippon_toc.htm). Shinto
is a complex belief system that endows everyday natural objects
with personality, called _kami_ (かみ). The _kami_ are not gods,
though oft-translated as such. The _kami_ are closer to patron
spirits of objects, the sacred associated with all sorts of things.
When you get frustrated at your cake falling and yell at it, you
get the idea. Shinto also includes a degree of ancestor worship,
where the ancestors themselves are also _kami_.

Buddhism is completely different. Japanese Buddhism is typically
associated with [Zen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22kmvNxJCzs).
However, several other strands of Buddhism live on in Japan, notably
[Pure Land](https://www.thoughtco.com/pure-land-buddhism-450043),
[Nichiren](https://www.sgi.org/about-us/buddhist-lineage/nichiren.html),
and
[Shingon](http://www.shingonbuddhism.org/information/what-is-shingon-buddhism.html).
These each place fundamental requirements on the adherents. For
instance, Pure Land has a belief in an afterlife. Nichiren is more
evangelical and Shingon is esoteric. But all of these streams of
thought share the [Four Noble
Truths](https://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/four-noble-truths).

Perhaps incredibly, there is nothing that prevents a person for
practicing Shinto and Buddhism. This is what makes religion in
Japan, and most of East Asia, different from the West. There's no
concept of exclusivity. And [practicing both is common
enough](https://www.japanspecialist.co.uk/travel-tips/shinto-buddhism-2/),
it is not even recognized by practitioners. Through the amalgamation
of belief systems,
[syncretism](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/ancient-medieval/syncretism/a/syncretism-article)
brings the belief systems together. But it makes it more difficult
to see where one belief ends and another begins.
