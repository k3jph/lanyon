I have two book reviews in the current issue of the [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org). In the second, I reviewed _[Uncertainty Quantification and Stochastic Modeling with MATLAB](http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067b07)_ by Eduardo Souza de Cursi and Rubens Sampaio.

From the review,

> Uncertainty quantification is a relatively new field within numerical analysis with applications across engineering, social sciences, and natural sciences as computer-based simulations and complex statistical analyses become core analytical methods.  The creators of deployed models, such as high-frequency traders and recommendation system devlopers, will also find this book applicable.

There are a pair of typos in the the first paragraph I hope to get fixed!
