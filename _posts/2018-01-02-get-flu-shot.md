The thing about the vaccinations is they work best when more people
have them. That may seem obvious, but complexity comes from why and
how. Let us assume a vaccine is 33 percent effective. [The flu
vaccine usually sits around this
value.](http://templatelab.com/flu-vaccination-effectiveness-studies/) It
does not mean that two-thirds of the people who get the vaccine get
the flu. That means that people who get the vaccine have a 2/3s
chance of catching the flu if they _otherwise would get the flu_.
Obviously, we do not know if you would get the flu otherwise, but
we can make a rough guess as to your probability of getting the flu
by looking at the people who do not get the vaccine.

That us only part of the question, though. We can model the progression
of a disease like influenza. The [most interesting models are
agent-based](http://epidemiologymatters.org/epidemiology-we-like/methods/agent-based-modeling/).
That means we create an agent (think of it as a virtual robot) that
interacts with other agents. This models the interactions people
have every day. For instance, you have a brief interaction with a
bank teller and maybe exchange cash. But the server at Wendy's is
making your food. It is a brief interaction, but it runs deep. And
people spend a lot of time with family members, which is more complex
and with more opportunity to transmit a disease. Then there is
someone in the line in front of you at Giant. You have almost no
interaction, but maybe its enough to transmit a disease. Each of
these interactions has varying likelihoods of transmitting a disease
and varying risk levels, depending on the complexity and length of
the interaction.

As an aside, sometimes you hear people talk about researchers wasting
money looking at zombie infection rates. Well, yes, they do do that.
But zombieism is a generic proxy for all sorts of different diseases.
And it is a bit more fun. [It is actually quite serious
research.](https://io9.gizmodo.com/map-shows-how-quickly-a-zombie-outbreak-would-spread-fr-1692010744)

So now imagine we have a collection of agents in a model interacting.
Say, a collection that looks like a student population at a school
for instance, employees of an office, or even patients in a hospital.
If one of the agents should "contract" the disease in the model,
we can see how the agent's interactions with others spread the
disease based on virulence (ease of transmission), interaction risk
(what we just talked about), and vaccination status combined with
effectiveness.

Obviously, the more people vaccinating, the greater the protection
overall. But the protection drops off radically when the vaccination
rate drops below about 9 out of every 10 people. This is true
regardless of disease, and it holds for influenza, measles, whooping
cough, and most everything else. [We call this herd
immunity.](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity) The important part
of all of this is everyone has to make an individual decision to
go get vaccinated, but the problem is they are making a decision
on behalf of everyone, not just themselves. The decision each person
makes has society-wide implications and effects. This is why insurance
companies pay for the vaccine, typically with no copay. It is much
cheaper overall for everyone to get jabbed and treat those who get
sick anyway than treat everyone who gets sick.

Finally, a lot of people say they do not get the big deal about
flu. However, most people really do not know what the flu is. They
had something they called the flu which was either a severe cold
or what is commonly called the "stomach flu." [The stomach flu is
not what we are talking about
here.](http://immunizealberta.ca/sites/default/files/downloads/flu-comparison-sheet.pdf)
That is usually rotavirus or norovirus. When I was a kid, we would
get a "stomach flu" and that just sucked a lot. But true influenza
is actually horrifying in comparison...and it has a decent shot at
killing you.

As another aside, since 2000, rotavirus vaccines have been commonly
available to children in the United States. [This has reduced the
infection rate in the United States by about 80
percent.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5237165/)
When I was a kid, the stomach flu was a once a year or so ordeal.
I think my children have had it collectively once.

To make a very long story short, the vaccination is not about you.
It is about all of us. And that is why you should get your flu shot.
