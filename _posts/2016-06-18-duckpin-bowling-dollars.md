[As noted on Wednesday by trashy Howard County blogger Bill
Woodcock](http://53beersontap.typepad.com/53beers/2016/06/june-25-see-and-make-little-pins-fly-around.html),
I will be taking part in duckpin bowling tournament next Saturday,
June 25.  My opponent in this tournament will be none other than
trashy Howard County blogger Bill Woodcock.  See, several weeks
ago, he posted the New York _Times_ article on the decline of duckpin
bowling on my Facebook page and challenged me to a throw down.

Lost Art of Duckpin Bowling"
style="border:none;max-width:500px;min-width:300px;min-height:550px;display:block;width:100%;"></iframe>

Little did Bill know, I was at [the AMF in
Timonium](https://www.amf.com/location/amf-timonium-lanes) when he
wrote his challenge.  I was born for this throwdown.  I have promised
all that my honorable opponent is full of stewed cabbage and Donald
Trump blustery. He shall be defeated and glory shall reign upon me
and my favored guests. My enemies shall be smote with the anger of
a thousand lionfish!

Of course, we are doing this for charity.  Bill is playing for
Living in Recovery in Howard County and I am playing for Planned
Parenthood.  Also, we have theme songs.  Obviously, mine is Taylor
Swift's "[Shake it Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM)"
and Bill's is "[SexyBack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOHvDP_vCs)"
by Justin Timberlake.  As Bill plays for the honor of Oakland Mills,
I promise, yet again, Long Reach shall crush them.
