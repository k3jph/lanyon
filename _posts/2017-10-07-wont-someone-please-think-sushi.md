A friend picked up the kids from the bus stop last night and I met
up with them for dinner at the neighborhood sushi restaurant.  See,
they love sushi.  Ducky is 5 and her favorite food is [salmon
roe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/07/the-nasty-bits-salmon-roe-with-scrambled-eggs.html),
which she calls "bubbles."  She also loves some raw tuna.  Chase
is 8 and his first solid food, literally, was [raw
tuna](https://www.thespruce.com/tuna-sashimi-with-daikon-and-ginger-1300697),
which he pulled off my plate and started gumming.

Now, why I am talking about this.  First, tuna is an apex predator.
It eats everything...including things that eat other things.  And
tuna is so very fatty...that's what makes it pretty tasty.

As organic compounds drop into the sea, they invariable end up in
the plant life and smallest animals.  This might be from an [oil
spill](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ari/article/view/40763),
degrading plastics, or [pesticides from
runoff](http://www.fao.org/docrep/w2598e/w2598e07.htm). This is not
good for them, but it is worse for the next member of the foodchain
up. The next fish up will absorb some naturally and accumulate more
through eating contaminated food.  This works all the way up and
the limiting factor is the partition coefficient between water and
the body fat in tuna, grouper, mackerel and other fish we eat.

If a chemical, organic or not, is particularly soluble in the body
fat, which we approximate with
[octanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octanol), then the fish can
absorb more of it.  This is why [pregnant women are advised to avoid
tuna](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/should-pregnant-women-eat-more-tuna/),
due to mercury accumulation.  The octanol-water coefficient of a
chemical represents how soluble the chemical will be in body fat
versus the water and we can estimate how much will end up in our
foodstocks.

As troubling as this is, there is good news.  Recent observations
have shown that there is a [decrease in toxins in fish
harvested](http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-fish-toxins-20160208-story.html).
This is good news for the fish, since they don't want to be poisoned
any more than I do.  And it means I can keep giving sushi to the
kids.
