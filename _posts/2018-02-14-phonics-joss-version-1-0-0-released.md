Today, I received news that [phonics](/software) and its
[associated
metapaper](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/13e41c9bd376fe2fc948f8af10b138b6)
were published in the _Journal of Open Source Software_ (_JOSS_).
At the culmination of nearly three years of off-and-on and haphazard
work on the project, I am pleased to see it has reached a critical
milestone.

Accordingly, I have decided it is time to cut a release and call
it 1.0.0. It feels like it is time.  And this is, of course, entirely
arbitrary, but here it is.  It's time to say it can stand on its
own.  That has been pushed to [CRAN, is
approved](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phonics/index.html), and
is spreading to CRAN mirrors globally.

So, while this [yak is not completely
shaved](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2005/03/05/yak-shaving.html), I
have enough yak hair here to get the job done.  [Happy Valentine's
Day to
