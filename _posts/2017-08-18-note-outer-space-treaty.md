The [Outer Space Treaty was adopted in
1967](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flr37&div=25&g_sent=1)
to establish a baseline of rules governing the acts and behavior
of those in operating beyond Earth's atmosphere.  In general, the
Treaty applies when acting in space, on the Moon, or "other celestial
bodies," which presumably means asteroids and other planets.  The
language of the treaty seems likely designed to have effect anywhere
outside Earth's atmosphere, generally promoting the peaceful use
of space resources.  The Outer Space Treaty provides many rules,
but several stand out as relevant to providing independent governing
structure in space.

One of the most important is that [nongovernmental actors are subject
to the supervision of their own governments in
space](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40706764).  Businesses, nonprofits,
and individuals are not prohibited from participating in space
activities; however, when they do, they do so under the supervision
of their respective governments, implying they are subject to their
national law while doing so.  Accordingly, when a private space
mission launches from the United States, the launcher must [receive
permission from the Federal Aviation
Administration[(http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jrlsl31&div=8&g_sent=1).
Under this standard, a privately-launched space colony must operate
under the laws of its home nation, effectively enshrining a long-arm
approach to governing in space.

More commonly known is the prohibition on the placement of nuclear
weapons in space.  The Outer Space Treaty expressly prohibits the
use of space for [nuclear weapons or any other type of "weapons of
mass
destruction"](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jrlsl4&div=6&g_sent=1&collection=journals).
Of course, this prohibition does not prohibit other military uses
of space, [as demonstrated by the Global Positioning
System](https://books.google.com/books?id=F7jrCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PR19&ots=zWk7pRvNtB&dq=global%20positioning%20system%20navy&lr&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false).
Further, it does not prohibit the use of governments generally.
The intent of this prohibition is to ensure the peaceful use of
space and discourage the development of space-based combat systems,
which would have a detrimental effect on all potential users.

From a standpoint of space governance, especially for a colony in
space, the prohibition on sovereign claims in the Outer Space Treaty
causes some difficulty.  The Treaty specifies that nations may
[neither claim nor occupy outer space or a celestial
body](http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flr37&div=25&g_sent=1&collection=journals).
The goal here is to prevent a nation from claiming a monopoly or
ownership of some body.  As the Treaty was adopted two years before
the first Moon landing, this prevented the United States from
claiming the Moon as its territory.  While it would be difficult
to enforce a claim without some sort of garrison, since 1972, the
United States has not returned and no other nation has succeeded
to establish a home there, even for a few hours.

In both a general sense, and as explicitly stated in the Outer Space
Treaty, the intent of the treaty was to establish that state actors
participating in exploring space would treat each other equitably
and with free access.  This essentially extends the norms of
international law, [a loosely defined set of relationships set by
custom and
treaty](https://books.google.com/books?id=uwiIAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&ots=BgRURJ3ghX&dq=international%20law&lr&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false),
to outer space.  However, there are some key differences with the
law of the sea.  For instance, the Law of the Sea Treaty, allows
nations to claim some territorial waters.  The Outer Space Treaty
contains nothing similar and leaves open the question of space
governance.
