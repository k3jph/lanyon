I got the kids a new book called _[Pond Life](http://www.amazon.com/Pond-Golden-Guide-Martins-Press/dp/1582381305)_.  I had the same book when I was about 5, and I remember getting it at the [Cincinnati Zoo](http://cincinnatizoo.org/).  The cover has changed, and it has supposedly been updated, but it is still the same basic book, a field guide to what happens in a small pond.

It includes some sections on aquatic life, plants, and other things you'd find around ponds.  The book should probably be standard issue in Columbia, now that I think about it.  ChaseKBH and BeaABH will have more opportunity to use it.  We live next to Jackson Pond in Columbia.  We often walk there and talk to the geese.  And quack at the ducks.  

The Golden Guides are a great series.  I also had one on geology, birds, and I think I had one on fossils.
