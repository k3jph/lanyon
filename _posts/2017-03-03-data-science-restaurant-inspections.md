At work, we just did a really neat set of predictive models for
restaurant inspections.  This is all based on the work [Chicago
did](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation) for
the analysis.

We kinda/sorta split into different groups and did analyses for
three cities (with links to reports):

* [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://github.com/iscoe/restaurant_inspections/blob/master/papers/Raleigh.pdf),
* [Syracuse, New York](https://github.com/iscoe/restaurant_inspections/blob/master/papers/Syracuse.pdf), and
* [Denver, Colorado](https://github.com/iscoe/restaurant_inspections/blob/master/papers/Denver.pdf).

Together, these three reports show different approaches and analyses
we used in the three different cities, along with discussion of how
we applied the Chicago work.  More information is available from
our GitHub page:
