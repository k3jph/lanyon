Plymouth Colony offers a counterpoint to the corporate colonization
of Jamestown if only because the Mayflower missed its destination.
The Mayflower was intended to arrive in Virginia with additional
settlers for the growing Virginia colony. However, the ship was
forced to put ashore at what is today Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts
[due to storms and a lack of food in
1620](https://www.jstor.org/stable/214550). This leads to a spontaneous
creation of self-governance among the Mayflower's passengers, though
self-governance was quickly overtaken through colonial rule directed
by the Crown through a local governor, just like in Virginia. This
placed Virginia and Massachusetts on equal footing as colonies with
separate, but roughly identical governance structures.

The Mayflower included two groups: the [Pilgrims and the non-Pilgrim
settlers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1923741) along for the voyage.
Realizing they were not in Virginia, some of the Strangers claimed
they were not bound by Crown rule, and planned to establish a [new
colony independent of Virginia](https://www.jstor.org/stable/364172).
The [Pilgrims wanted to maintain ties to
England](https://www.jstor.org/stable/366234), and the two groups
negotiated the Mayflower Compact before leaving the ship. This
agreement paved the way for the [Plymouth General
Court](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/327/william-bradford-the-puritan-ethic-the-mayflower-compact),
which was the Plymouth legislature and judicial court from 1620 to
1692, [when Plymouth was merged into Massachusetts
Bay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25080920), creating one colonial
province for the region.

The original text of the [Mayflower Compact is
lost](https://ia802306.us.archive.org/0/items/mayflowercompact00bow/mayflowercompact00bow.pdf),
but early copies are available and make its function and intent
clear. William Bradford's [transcription is remarkably
short](https://books.google.com/books?id=eBxEAQAAMAAJ&ots=tt_0qOX0RO&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false),
a single paragraph, and the document provides little in the way of
a modern constitutional framework. However, the Compact, offered a
few key essentials. First, the Compact stated the colonists'
allegiance to the Crown. Second, the Compact states the colonists
"covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick."
With this statement, the colonists established themselves as a
political entity and allowed for self-government, something Virginia
had lost by then. Further, the Compact states the laws established
by the colonists would be ``just and equal.''

Between 1620 and 1627, the [Plymouth Colony faced similar problems
to
Jamestown](http://www.sjsu.edu/people/ruma.chopra/courses/h170_M_F11/s2/Conflict_Pigs_NE.pdf),
leading to the [well-known Thanksgiving
story](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/gfc.2003.3.4.79).
However, the colonists were concerned about the potential for
conflicting land claims with respect to Virginia and sought a
separate royal charter for Massachusetts Bay. The charter was granted
and under this charter, the government of Massachusetts formalized
local structures that had already been operating for areas in
Massachusetts that were not a part of Plymouth. The local town
councils continued and eventually the [Massachusetts General Court
was established](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/422395) as the colonial
legislature and highest judicial authority in Massachusetts Bay.
The legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts retains the
name Massachusetts General Court today, even though it retains no
judicial functions.

Operating outside the context of a royal charter, either indirectly
as Jamestown started, or directly as Virginia was by 1624, the
Mayflower Compact created a direct democracy and allowed the fledgling
colony to kickoff without direct expected support. Further, as
noted, the Compact was created immediately by the colony members
upon the realization that no other governance structure existed,
showing the obvious need for self-governance for the group. Under
the Mayflower Compact, the structures of the modern Massachusetts
government for created, along with guarantees of freedom and equality.
Many of those principles continue in the American tradition, showing
the influence a small support system can have on self-rule centuries
later.
