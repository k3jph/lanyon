It's been another month and now there's another study on the costs and benefits relating to flooding.  This week's entry is [Oregon State's Steven Dundas](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Dundas/publication/283710651_The_benefits_and_costs_of_constructed_dunes_Evidence_from_the_New_Jersey_coast/links/5643986e08ae9f9c13e055a5.pdf) who writes on the costs and benefits of artificial dunes on the Jersey shore. 

Overall, Dundas shows these dunes provide a net benefit, especially by reducing net exposure of the [NFIP](/tag/NFIP).  This is to be expected since natural barriers are known to reduce flood damage and can mitigate the risk.  But that savings in exposure is compensated by a $1700 loss per house.  That's a problem because that has to be paid by either the state or Federal government.  Further, these costs are highly regressive since they support a few, generally wealthier homeowners, at the expense of everyone else.
