So it's time to talk about flood insurance cancellation again.
Again.  Again.

Authorization for the National Flood Insurance Program is set to
expire on July 31.  This happens every couple of years, but the
program continues to be necessary to manage short-term risk of
flooding, especially in the middle of the hurricane season.

The real problem is that Congress seems unwilling to actually
reauthorize the program, mostly because it is too expensive.  On
the other hand, Congress is unwilling to introduce the reforms
necessary to rein in costs of the program and ensure that it can
be successful over the long term.

The _Insurance Journal_ blog has a great summary of the current
state of affairs with the NFIP, including tracking of several
reauthorization measures.

But none of these measures seem set to be a real solution.  The
closest to a long-term solution is a standalone six-month
reauthorization.  Congress cannot keep kicking the can down the
road without a plan for real reform.
