We did Andrew Gelman's [candy weighing
demonstration](http://andrewgelman.com/2008/05/08/doing_the_candy/) in
class on Friday. This was the first time I've had a chance to teach
sampling in some time and really wanted to do it. These were not
traditional statistics students, however. We did this in [research
methods](/teaching). So these are students interested
in management and getting drug through a statistics course. And
that might be putting it nicely.

Nevertheless, they were good about the experiment. We also had some
slight modifications to Gelman's procedure. First, we used the
measurements (in grams) printed right on the side of the packaging.
And everyone did it individually since I only had six students
(traffic was bad). And, finally, students were instructed to use
something between 10 and 20 instances for sampling. After that, it
was their choice how to sample and estimate the mass of the bag.

| Estimate 	| Mass (grams) 	|
|----------	|--------------	|
| 1        	| 6744.07      	|
| 2        	| 6988         	|
| 3        	| 6822.75      	|
| 4        	| 4715         	|
| 5        	| 9449         	|
| 6        	| 9000         	|

It's worth noting that estimate number 6 was taken as a guess by
the student after lifting the entire bag. As expected, the total
mass was lower than predicted for 5 of the 6 estimates. The total
weight was 5558.3 grams.

This lead to a good discussion of sampling and sample design. We
also used it as an opportunity to talk about data weights. Overall,
the students also noted it was a better demonstration than a
straightforward lecture would have been.
