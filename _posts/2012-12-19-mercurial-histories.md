I put a lot of stuff into Mercurial including research, letters, and miscellaneous documents as they are being developed. When a new project shares some common element (such as, for instance, page formatting) with an older project, Iâ€™ll fork from the older project into the new one leaving them with a common history, even if they have no other logical or other connection between the two.
