After slightly more than a year, I have moved jameshoward.us back to [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) from [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.org).  While Textpattern is solid software, the flexibility that comes with Mediawiki for handling abstract page types is unmatched.  All the old content is still available, including the [Howard County Search](/hcs) engine.  Page links are altered slightly, as they have gone back to standard Mediawiki notation.  Old page slugs no longer work.

Thank you for your patience, and if you see any problems, please [contact me](/contact-me).
