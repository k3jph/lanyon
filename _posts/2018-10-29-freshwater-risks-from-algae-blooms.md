Here in Maryland, we spend a lot of time talking about [eutrophication
in the Chesapeake
Bay](https://jameshoward.us/2017/07/10/eutrophication-reduction-local-limits/),
but eutrophication can also be a threat to our freshwater supplies.
This has most seriously affected Toledo in recent years.  In [2014,
Toledo](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/lifting-ban-toledo-says-its-water-is-safe-to-drink-again.html)
had to shut down freshwater feeds from Lake Erie due to
eutrophication-caused toxins in the water.

Like our concerns here, much of the Toledo problem was caused by
industrialized application of fertilizers.  There's a runoff problem
and phosphorus is swept from the soil to the nearest body of water.
In the case of Toledo, much of the problem stemmed from farmlands
located across the border with Michigan.  As more and more fertilizer
headed into Lake Erie, instead of fertilizing crops, it fertilized
algae.  The algae, growing more abundantly than it had ever known,
promptly crowded out everything else.  The algae, much of it toxic,
left the water undrinkable.

This is going to be a continuing problem in American lakes.  More
than 45 million people live in the Great Lakes watershed and most
of them get their water from the lakes or its water sources.  As
long as there is more fertilizer being dumped into the water, the
Great Lakes will continue to see toxic algae blooms, placing drinking
water at risk.  And this is true in every other water source, too.
