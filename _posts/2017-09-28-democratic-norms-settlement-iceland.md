Iceland today is a small island of roughly 300,000 people in the
North Atlantic, often credited as the [oldest functioning
democracy](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230299467_7).
Iceland was originally colonized by Norse migrants leaving Scandinavia
in [search of land in the Ninth
Century](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40623522).  Except for a few
monks, the Norse settlers found an uninhabited island and began
claiming tracks of land.  Due to a remarkably [high degree of
literacy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/old-icelandic-literature-and-society/from-orality-to-literacy-in-medieval-iceland/FF01208C951B732479A100BBD55241EC)
among the earliest Iceland Settlers, substantial and detailed records
exist of this of this settlement period.  We can use these settlement
records to understand how the people of Iceland interacted with
each other, developing elementary government.

Starting in 874, Iceland was rapidly colonized by northern European
settlers.  The period of colonization, known as the Age of Settlement,
[lasted for about fifty-five years](http://www.jstor.org/stable/124920)
and ended when unclaimed land was no longer available.  The
documentation of the time, the Sagas, described an agrarian people
and recorded a settlement period of family farms, not major cities.
The population in A.D. 930, the traditional end date of the Age of
Settlement, [was estimated at 30,000](http://www.jstor.org/stable/213106)
over about [1400 individual
settlements](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816300861),
many of these people having been born on the island and knowing no
other land.  As the population grew, a denser population drove more
interactions between individuals and necessitated the development
of laws to govern those interactions.

The year A.D. 930 was also the year the Althingi was established.
Bringing with them traditional Norse values and social constructions,
the early Icelandic settlers built community governance structures
modeled on those [traditional governance
forms](http://www.viking.ucla.edu/publications/articles/icelandic_allthing.pdf),
a town meeting called the thing, consisting of all free men in the
village.  Eventually, larger scale governance was required and the
Althingi brought together chieftains from around Iceland every
summer.  The Althingi had both judicial and legislative powers.
While the "Law Speaker" filled a role as parliamentarian and historian
of the body, there was no island-wide executive function.

The structure and timing of settlement had distinctive implications
for establishing governance structures in Iceland.  In _[Viking Age
Iceland](https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Age-Iceland-Jesse-Byock/dp/0140291156)_,
Byock notes that because early Icelandic governance was not based
on historical tribal allegiances, "the cultural focus was the law."
In addition, the settlement encouraged a strong sense of private
property and ownership that was widely respected, even without the
traditional enforcement mechanisms of state, such as a central
police force.  Further, military forces were not required to maintain
control over Iceland.  Nevertheless, while superficially resembling
a democratic republic, early Iceland's governance was only for a
single upper class.  By the Thirteenth Century, class division had
weakened the democratic institutions and King Hakon of Norway was
declared King of Iceland.

Despite its eventual dissolution and weak democratic structure,
early Iceland provides a guide for how societies can self-organize,
especially when the entire social structure is, itself, new.  Without
an existing population, the settlers were able to build social
structures that were responsive to their own needs, and not worrying
about outside influence or risk.  At the same time, the social
structure was not perfect.  Like many agrarian societies, the social
structure was highly patriarchal, with primary political power
vested in the male heads of families.  We can also see how Icelandic
settlers adopted their historical cultural institutions to meet
their new needs.  When creating a national assembly, the structure
and even name came from the old Norse town assembles.  Together,
we can see a desire for self-rule is important to colonial independence.
