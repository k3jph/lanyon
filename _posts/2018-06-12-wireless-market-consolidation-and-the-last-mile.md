I almost never blog about business, and it is strange I should break
the drudgery of recent silence with a business post, but I have a
thought that just won't leave.

The Court will rule today in the [AT&T-Time Warner merger
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/technology/att-time-warner-trial-antitrust-ruling.html)
and everyone is all atitter over the outcome.  If this comes down
in favor of the merger, we can expect to see more
content-delivery/content-production vertical mergers.  At least,
that's the conventional wisdom.

But there's a more interesting merger in the pipeline right now:
the proposed [T-Mobile/Sprint
merger](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/30/what-the-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-means-for-you/?utm_term=.7fb4c9eb6586)
which is reportedly got the [Department of Justice all up in
arms](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/u-s-justice-dept-probes-t-mobile-sprint-merger-effect.html).
Either this merger goes through or it does not, and I am not here
to analyze that.  What I am here to say is if the merger happens,
within two years, Comcast will buy up the merged phone company.
And if the merger does not happen, Comcast will buy one of the
two...probably T-Mobile.

Here's my reasoning:  Right now, Verizon is a massive wireless
carrier that also has an impressive high-speed television and
Internet product (FiOS).  AT&T is also a massive wireless carrier
that has a strong contender in high-speed television and Internet
in [DIRECTV](https://www.directv.com/) (I've seen a lot of DIRECTV
dishes out there in my recent wanderings).  Comcast already owns a
major content producer in NBCUniversal and the Xfinity product line
provides high-speed television and Internet.  They lack the wireless
component...and I bet they want it.  Since the [top two wireless
carriers are Verizon and
AT&T](https://www.statista.com/statistics/199359/market-share-of-wireless-carriers-in-the-us-by-subscriptions/),
with T-Mobile a distant third, that's their best bet.  It's even
better for Comcast if the T-Mobile/Sprint merger goes through, as
the combined company will have 30% of the United States market,
just under each of Verizon and AT&T.

_Disclosure: I own a single share of T-Mobile common stock.  Also,
I **really** hate Comcast._
