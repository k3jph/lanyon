A few of weeks ago, I posted a couple of essays I wrote during a
Coursera course on Buddhism and meditation.  At the time, I also
found an excellent introduction to Eastern religions overall.
Professor David Makinster at Greenfield Community College has
recently taught his course, Philosophy 110: Eastern Religions,
online and the entire video collection is available on YouTube, for
free.

The course, kind of, starts in India with Hinduism and travels east
and forward in time.  Through this, Prof. Makinster introduces
Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, and many of the closely
related and major branches of each philosophical structure.  Anyway,
Makinster does an excellent job with the course and if you want to
learn more about eastern philosophy, it's worth watching the videos.
