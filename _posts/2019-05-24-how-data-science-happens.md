I have a chapter in our planned book, _[Handbook of Military and
Defense Operations Research](/books/mdor/)_.  In this book, co-edited
with Prof. [Natalie Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com), our
authors explore the fundamentals of operations research in a military
context. From our call for chapters:

> Operations research (OR) is a core discipline in military and
defense management. Coming to the forefront initially during World
War II, OR provided critical contributions to managing supply chains,
strategic simulation, and enabled superior management for Allied
forces. Since these early days, OR has grown to include analytics
and many applications, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
and big data, and is the cornerstone of management science in
manufacturing, advertising, telecommunications, and many other
fields. In the _Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research_
(_MDOR_), we will present the voices leading OR and analytics to
new heights in security through research, practical applications,
and lessons learned in the field.

My chapter in this book is an introduction to data science. It is
general, but is presented in the context of national security and
is largely based on my own experience working in the homeland
security sector. This is a draft chapter, and so it may go through
a major rewrite. But it has already been through one and I just
uploaded the [current version to
SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3393965). Feel
free to send me any comments or suggestions you have.
