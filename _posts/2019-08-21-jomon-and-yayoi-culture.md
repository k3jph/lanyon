_I am taking a course on Japanese history for funsies so expect to
see a fair bit of Japanese history popping up here over the next
few months..._

The
[Jomon](https://www.world-archaeology.com/features/jomon-and-early-japan/)
and [Yayoi](https://www.ancient.eu/Yayoi_Period/) cultures predated
modern Japanese culture on the Japanese islands. It is important
to understand these are not proto-Japanese cultures, though some
of the early elements of them continue today. The Jomon culture is
primarily handed to us today via architectural finds, especially
those clay pottery and figures. This is such a key element, Jomon
itself means "[patterns of plaited
cord](https://www.thoughtco.com/japan-ancient-cultures-4070770)."
An example of a Jomon figure is above, called a dogÅ« and shows a
[typically-Jomon
aesthetic](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/10/02/arts/the-dogu-have-something-to-tell-us/)
of goggle-eyes.

The end of the Jomon period transitions away from hunting and
gathering and other Neolithic traits. This period, starting around
1000 BCE, starts agriculture on the Japanese islands and the
[formalization of traditional Shinto rites and
religion](https://www.greenshinto.com/wp/2013/06/27/jomon-spirituality/).
At the end of the transition period, the Yayoi culture arises and
defines the population of Japan from about 300 BCE to 250 CE. This
period, notably, is before [Buddhism's arrival in
Japan](http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/kofun.html).

Yayoi culture was defined by the [development of formal
agriculture](http://factsanddetails.com/japan/cat16/sub105/entry-5287.html).
The most interesting aspect, though, is the first appearance of a
reference to Japan in the [Chinese historical
record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_(Japan)). In the Chinese
historical record, the [Japanese are
described](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/history-yayoi-period.htm)
as living in a feudal state with small-scale mercantilism and
[shamanistic Shinto rituals](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shinto).
