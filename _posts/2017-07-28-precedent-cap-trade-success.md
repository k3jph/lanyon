The Clean Air Act has had a great many benefits for the environment
and public health, but it's most important aspect is what it can
show.  Most economists and scientists suggest an important defense
against global climate change is carbon trading, or
[cap-and-trade](http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/reduce-emissions/cap-trade-carbon-tax),
The idea behind cap-and-trade is simple.  Everyone who needs to
dump carbon gets a fixed amount to dump.  This provides a cap on
how much is available for everyone and limit on the total growth
of carbon in the atmosphere.  Some people will legitimately need
more than the limit...and some will need less.  Those who need less
will sell their credits to those who need more.  The global cap
stays fixed, but carbon starts to get allocated a bit more efficiently.
As time marches on, some organizations might develop cleaner
technologies that need even less carbon, or not at all.  This becomes
a winner for everyone.

Opponents of cap-and-trade claim it won't work.  [Some say it will
wreck the economy and cause job
losses.](http://www.npr.org/2014/06/03/318414868/gop-demonizes-once-favored-cap-and-trade-policy)
Others say it won't work because it is not possible to cut emissions
in some cases.

In the late 1980s, I was a kid and everyone was [talking about acid
rain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1988/04/05/what-causes-acid-rain/3644e5ad-0e45-4de6-905d-dfdeee06cde8/?utm_term=.b894dc0cb9a6)
the same way people talk about carbon emissions today.  Of course,
we don't hear much about acid rain today.  By 2011, the atmospheric
pollutants behind acid rain, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, had
[fallen by 64 and 67
percent](https://www.citylab.com/life/2013/09/50-years-after-its-discovery-acid-rain-offers-lesson-climate-change/6837/),
respectively, over their early 1990s peaks.  This is due to the
Clean Air Act.

The [Clean Air Act of 1990](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview)
contained amendments that created a trading market for sulfur
dioxide.  The market capped emissions and allowed users to trade
emissions credits for money.  Some were able to reduce their emissions
for less than the money they could get on the trading market.  Others
continue emissions, but overall, the program has been a huge success.
In other words, cap-and-trade does work.

Now, in the case of carbon, it will be more complicated.  The biggest
problem with carbon is that there are many more point sources of
emissions than there are sulfur dioxide.  Those many more point
sources are our cars, which account for just under 20 percent of
American carbon emissions.  And most people are unlikely to participate
in a market, because the relative value is not worth it and most
people have other things to do, like feed their children.  Larger
emitters, like power generators, already have much of the infrastructure
necessary to participate in the market.  This complication means
individual emissions should be approached either by allocating
emissions to vehicle manufacturers or possible gasoline producers.
Likely, a combination of both is appropriate.

All of this means that cap-and-trade can work and has worked in the
past, even the recent past.  Some countries are adopting it already,
as are some states, most notably,
[California](https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm).  Not
only does it work, but it is a good, responsible, and market-based
solution to slowing global climate change.
