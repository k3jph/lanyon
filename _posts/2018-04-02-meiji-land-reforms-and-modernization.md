An open question in history is why Japan was able to successfully
modernize following Commodore Perry's "[opening of
Japan](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/opening-to-japan)."
In a recent discussion of this, I proposed that three reasons drove
Japan's success.  First is the [adoption of free-market
economics](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309816810378723).
Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Emperor implemented
market reforms, most importantly, opening Japan to foreign trade.
This affects a number of aspects of Japan, but the first is that
free markets generally like to trade with each other.  Krugman,
among many others, [explains this
phenomenon](https://www.kansascityfed.org/NNflZ/publicat/sympos/1991/S91krugm.pdf).
This gave Japan a number of trading partners and allowed the economy
to grow.  But a growing economy also supports a growing middle
class, [much as we are seeing in China
today](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X09001983).

Hand-in-hand with free markets, the second reason Japan was successful
focuses on the adoption of a relatively liberal political structure.
The most important of these gave direct control of land to individuals
throughout the country.  Between 1870 and 1873, the Imperial
government established land rights and created a simple and equitable
[taxation system around land
ownership](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1152149).  [Dore argues that
giving land
rights](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1746-1049.1965.tb00770.x)
directly to the land users allowed them to make the most effective
use of the land.  And sell it when it was in their best interest.
Brammal points out that while moving more slowly, [China has adopted
similar land
reforms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2004.00074.x),
especially since 1982, and benefited economically while society has
opened some.

Both of these reforms were made possible by one other aspect.  Unlike
China, Japan had a relatively unified government following the Meiji
Restoration.  At that point, [the shogunate was answerable to the
Emperor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2941545.pdf).  Accordingly,
when the Emperor decided to implement a reform, the shogunate was
empowered to implement the decision.  The Emperor encouraged personal
loyalty from those who previously held high standing by preserving
that standing, if not the actual power associated with it.  In that
way, for instance, [samurai and daimyo kept some manner of
prestige](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2943582.pdf).  This follows
a pattern common in political change.  Often, the change is in name
only.
