I've been learning a bit of [signal
processing](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/our-story/signal-processing-101),
lately, for a variety of reasons. I spent a lot of time on YouTube
watching videos to learn more. As I am sure you're aware, YouTube
uses what you have watched to recommend more videos to you. This
was one it recommended:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU">"Hello, world" from scratch on a 6502 - Part 1</a></h4><p>Learn how computers work in this series where I build and program a basic computer with the classic 6502 microprocessor. More info: https://www.eater.net/650...</p></blockquote>

Now, this had a way of catching my attention. I grew up playing
with an [Atari
1200XL](http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8bits/1200xl/1200xl.html), and
I learned how to program on one of these when I was eightish. The
1200XL, like so many other computers of the day, had a [MOS Technology
6502](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor)
at the core. I figured this would be some sort of assembly language
tutorial, so I put it on, while I did something else.

Whoa, no, that's not what this is. The creator, a gentleman named
[Ben Eater](https://eater.net/) used this to document building a
[6502-based](http://6502.org/) computer on a breadboard. It's really
a beautiful thing to watch, but it is one of the things that gets
us to stable circuits. In order to make this go, and show it off,
he slows it way down. Instead of running the processor at 8Mhz ,
or whatever the chip is spec'ed at, he uses his own clock, developed
in another set of videos.

In these videos, he uses three [555
timers](https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/TechTip/555-timer-tutorial.html).
The 555 have three modes: astable, bistable, and monostable. He
uses each of three modes, one for each timer, to allow the clock
to function in three different ways. The first is that the block
ticks merrily away, with the speed controlled by a rheostat. The
second disables the clock signal, effectively putting the output
on pause. The third, and this is awesome, allows you to single-step
the clock by pushing a button, during the pause.

Anyway, and OMG, he has kits available! So I have ordered, and just
received the other day, the kits for the 6502 computer and the
clock. Unfortunately, this weekend was reserved for a different
science project with the kids (long story, very complicated, Pok√©mon
is involved). But I am looking forward to building the clock, for
the start, in the next week or so!
