> Water is the key to life, but it is also our greatest enemy. We
can't go more than a few days without a drink, but it can kill
millions at a time. When water combines with wind, devastating
hurricanes form. They wreck ships, destroy cities, and flood areas
from horizon to horizon. They are even given names.

Everyone, I am happy to say that today, [Steve Jackson
Games](http://www.sjgames.com/) released my new sourcebook, _[GURPS
Disasters:
Hurricane.](https://jameshoward.us/games/gurps-disasters-hurricane/)_ The
sourcebook covers how hurricanes form, what happens when they strike,
and the recovery process and is designed to be integrated with any
GURPS campaign. Like other GURPS sourcebooks, it can be used with
almost any roleplaying game.

The story of writing this is a bit interesting. A year ago, I
stumbled across the Steve Jackson Games website. I had never played
GURPS nor read a GURPS book. All I knew about Steve Jackson Games
came from the _[The Hacker
Crackdown](https://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html)_, Bruce Sterling's
1992 book about [Operation
Sundevil](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315155852/chapters/10.1201/9781315155852-11).
I, of course, downloaded this book from a BBS and read it when I
was like 13\. Steve Jackson Games ended up playing a strange role
in all of this:

> "G.U.R.P.S." served as a framework for creating a wide variety
of artificial fantasy worlds. Steve Jackson Games published a
smorgasboard (sic) of books, full of detailed information and gaming
hints, which were used to flesh-out many different fantastic
backgrounds for the basic GURPS framework.

I was learning about the [Legion of
Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Doom_(hacking)) and
_[Phrack](http://www.phrack.org/)_. But here was this other thing,
I had no idea what it meant. I grew up in a part of Ohio where
people didn't know the difference between _[Mazes and
Monsters](https://mashable.com/2015/10/28/tom-hanks-dungeons-dragons/)_ and
reality. Roleplaying games were tantamount to playing cards with
Satan himself. So, like everything else I read, it was filed away
for potential later use. It only took twenty-five years for that
happen!

So anyway, I was at the Steve Jackson Games website when I started
browsing the catalog and noticed they wanted someone to write up
how to game a hurricane. I didn't know much about roleplaying but
[I do know
hurricanes](https://jameshoward.us/scholarship/environmental-studies/). So
I sent them a pitch and here we are!

You can buy the sourcebook from [Warehouse 23 today for six
dollars](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-disasters-hurricane).
