When I was a teenager, my father worked at the [LeSourdsville
Regional Water Reclamation
Facility](http://des.butlercountyohio.org/html/wastewater/LeSourdsville.cfm).
He worked second shift, and I worked for the [Butler County Auditor's
Office](http://www.butlercountyauditor.org/), so it wasn't unusual
to run out to the plant.  Maybe delivering dinner or just chilling.
I had to drive right by on the way home from
[MUM](https://miamioh.edu/regionals/about/regional-locations/middletown/index.html),
so I'd also occasionally drop by after class.  It all means I spent
way too much time as a teenager hanging out at a wastewater treatment
plant.

At the end of the process there, they ended up with [sewage
sludge](http://www.sludgenews.org/about/) and it was as gross as
you can imagine.  It's a typically dried powder of the biosolids
remaining after wastewater treatment.  That is, it is dried poop
that's been eaten by assorted bacteria and other microbes.  One of
the things you can do with this is to use it as fertilizer.  A lot
of farms get this stuff and use it to feed the plants.  What goes
around comes around, I guess.

It turns out there are a lot of benefits to doing this.  First of
all, the material is organic and enhances the quality of soil,
overall.  That helps soil absorb moisture and adds other nutrients,
especially nitrogen, that plants need.  It also keeps the sewage
sludge out of landfills and reduces greenhouse gas emissions from
incineration.

There are some downsides to using sewage sludge as fertilizer.  One
is that it can smell bad.  Another is that it may carry some disease
vectors.  The good news in both cases is that the sunlight generally
kills odor and disease vectors relatively quickly.  The big downside
to using sewage sludge as a fertilizer is, like any fertilizer,
there is concern about groundwater and surface water contamination.
All the goodies in the water for plants is also good for things we
may not want growing.  For instance, [runoff, when reaching major
bodies of water, can lead to
eutrophication](https://jameshoward.us/2018/10/29/freshwater-risks-from-algae-blooms/).
Finally, there are concerns about [heavy metals in sewage
sludge](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986993/).

Generally, there are some benefits but the downsides need to be
assessed at weighed in the application.  There are certainly crops
and locations for which the downsides are sufficiently minimized.
However, sewage sludge in urban farming sounds like it would be
unpleasant for everyone.
