And in other news, I am teaching [People and Project
Administration](https://libguides.cmich.edu/msa647/Websites) at
[Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/Pages/default.aspx).
It's a good course with a focus on the people side of project
management.  But since it is always good, I kick a little [agile
methodology](https://www.cio.com/article/3156998/agile-development/agile-project-management-a-beginners-guide.html)
in at the end.

The course is online and six weeks, so there's no reason not to
take it!  And it would count for your 35 hours of project management
education for the PMP!  You can see the syllabus on my [management
teaching page](/teaching/).
