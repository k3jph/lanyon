The Howard County Charter Review Commission has spent about a year
now reviewing the County Charter. We've held a number of public
hearings. And we are currently drafting a set of preliminary
recommendations. The report is not ready yet, and will _probably_
be available before the end of February.

On March 3, 2020, the Charter Review Commission will be holding a
public hearing on the draft recommendations for review before they
are presented to the County Council later this spring. The hearing
will be at 7:00pm in the Banneker Room at 3430 Court House Drive,
Ellicott City.

I will post a copy of the draft report as soon as it is available.
