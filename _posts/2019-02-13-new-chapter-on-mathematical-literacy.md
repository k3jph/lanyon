I am quite happy to see that [Shifting Contexts, Stable Core:
Advancing Quantitative Literacy in Higher
Education](https://www.maa.org/press/ebooks/shifting-contexts-stable-core-advancing-quantitative-literacy-in-higher-education),
a new volume from MAA Press edited by [Luke
Tunstall](https://msu.edu/~tunstal1/), [Gizem
Karaali](http://pages.pomona.edu/~gk014747/), and [Victor
Piercey](https://www.ferris.edu/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics/mathematics-faculty-staff/victor-piercey.htm).
The volume collects papers on mathematical literacy and addresses
many ways we can improve it. From the description:

> The theme we take up in this collection is Shifting Contexts,
Stable Core, the idea being that while the construct of quantitative
literacy has remained relatively stable over recent years, the
application of this construct remains transient. For example, since
the 2001 publication of Mathematics and Democracy, a number of new
phenomena and technologies have flooded the realm of public
consciousness, providing new contexts to practice quantitative
literacy—a constant flux that can be at once both exhilarating and
overwhelming for those involved in teaching and creating QL courses.
Here we seek to capture and acknowledge such flux.  > > From a
thematic standpoint, we have organized this collection around three
motifs: Vision and (Re)visions, Curricula for Quantitative Literacy,
and Quantitative Literacy in an Institutional Context. Vision and
(Re)visions is meant to engage readers with a rich collection of
reflection and analysis on the evolution and nature of QL from those
who have been involved with the MAA and QL for several decades. In
the next section, we include discussions of ways in which authors’
visions have manifested through a variety of curricular themes
(including finance, the environment, and social justice, among other
topics). Our third and final section of the volume, Quantitative
Literacy in an Institutional Context, centers on institutional
matters of program growth and assessment, among other things. The
chapters of the volume illuminate how far the MAA’s QL community
has come over the past decades, demonstrating that Steen’s 2004
Urgent Challenge for universities has not gone unanswered.

I am happy to see a chapter, "Quantitative Literacy to New Quantitative
Literacies," coauthored by [Jeffrey
Craig](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/jccraig), [Rohit
Mehta](https://mehtarohit.com/), and myself, is included in this
text. In this chapter, we discuss how mathematical literacy is
becoming a broader requirement in today's world. From our introduction:

> Researchers and policy-makers have tried to illustrate the
relationship between numeracy and literacy in various ways: from
distinctly separate, with numeracy as the mirror image of literacy
to quantitative literacy as one subset within a broad literacy
conceptualization. When quantitative literacy or numeracy scholars
conceptualize their work in reference to literacy, they invoke
longstanding narratives about literacy that position their within
public and scholarly discourse in particular ways. These longstanding
narratives include that, historically, literacy has been a battleground
for power and equity; an historical tracing of literacy likely leads
to issues of power and oppression through time: from poor serfs
fighting for literacy as a right after the invention of the printing
press, through laws in the United States forbidding slaves from
learning to read and write, to the work of Paulo Freire teaching
literacy as a means for the oppressed to realize their exploitation
and empower themselves. Steen claimed that "an innumerate citizen
is as vulnerable as the illiterate peasant of Gutenberg’s time."

As we see more and more every day, mathematical knowledge is necessary
to just to handle the basics. If you're a member of the
[MAA](https://www.maa.org), you can download the book for free.
Otherwise, look for it for sale, soon.
