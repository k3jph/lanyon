Our paper, "Crystal Cube: Multidisciplinary Approach to Disruptive
Events Prediction," is going to be presented at the [9th International
Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE 2018) and
the Affiliated Conferences](http://www.ahfe2018.org/), which is
like 20 simultaneous conferences held at the same time and place,
which is July 21-25 in Orlando.  Anyway, I am not presenting the
paper, but the paper itself has been finalized!  Here's the abstract
and a copy of the accepted manuscript:

> The goal of Crystal Cube is to create an automated capability for
the prediction of disruptive events. In this paper we present initial
prediction results on six prediction categories previously shown
to be of interest in the literature. In particular, we compare the
performance of static classification models, often used in previous
work for these prediction tasks, with a gated recurrent unit sequence
model that has the ability to retain information over long periods
of time for the classification of sequence data. Our results show
that the sequence model is comparable in performance to the best
performing static model (the random forest), and that more work is
needed to classify highly dynamic prediction categories with high
probability.

may become easier to foresee disruptive events such as civil war,
religious violence, or international crises with some measure of
notice, and take preemptive action to mitigate risks associated
with the event.  More details are in the paper.
