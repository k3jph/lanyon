I was in a meeting yesterday with [Christina
Pikas](http://christinaslisrant.scientopia.org/) and several others.
I and the others all had our laptops out.  Christina had a notebook
and pen.  I said, something about not using technology, and she
reminded me that pen and paper are technology.  And I should have
known better.

A week before, in an online discussion with [Allison
Berg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonberg1292/), she mentioned
using bison grazing to attack climate change.  This was a way to
combat climate change without technology.  And I had to play
contrarian.

I think all solutions are technology-based. Just because there isn't
a circuit board, doesn't mean it isn't technology. At some point
in the past, every technology was bleeding edge. Maybe that means
there were beta-testers for the wheel.

I just looked up the word "technology" and it comes from the Greek
meaning "science of craft." Now, I promise I am not just being
pedantic and I have a point. Let's see if I stick the landing.

The idea is that I don't think this approach should be considered
revolutionary or novel. We know that plants eat CO2 and spit out
yummy-yummy oxygen. Planting a bunch of plants is a great idea, but
it is part of a full spectrum of solutions that we have to use.
Some will be based on our oldest technology: agriculture. Some will
be based on the newest silicon-based carbon fiber-backed solar cells
for on-site power generation. And the rest will fall somewhere
between.
