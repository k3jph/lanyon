I am honored to say the Howard County Council [reappointed me to the County's Board of Appeals](https://apps.howardcountymd.gov/olis/PrintSummary.aspx?LegislationID=1570) last night.  I thank the Council for this remarkable experience and the trust and faith to do it for another five years.  

I don't get to write about the Board of Appeals here.  Our matters are all ["quasi-judicial."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-judicial_body)  This has the effect of making them practically off-limits for any discussion outside of the formal hearing environment.  It's kind of like being on a never-ending jury.  Around Howard County, not talking about work is kind of a thing, anyway, so that's okay.  But if [you ever have a random evening to spare](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals), it's worth coming up to watch us in action.
