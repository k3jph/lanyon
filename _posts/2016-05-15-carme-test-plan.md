This week in the [Coursera IoT Capstone Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-of-things-project/home/welcome), we had to complete a test plan document.  The plan had to include both component and integration testing.  I have posted the test plan document to the [Carme Project page](https://jameshoward.us/projects/carme/).
