Two weeks ago, I was tasked by the [Charter Review
Commission](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/About-Us/Commissions-Task-Forces-and-Special-Reports/Charter-Review-Commission-2019)
to come up with a quick report and analysis of how other counties
in Maryland have structured their zoning change processes. For
background, in Howard County, changes to the Zoning Regulations, a
separate codification of laws, are made by the County Council through
the regular legislative process, except that that bills modify a
different codification. There are some minor procedural differences,
too, in that the Planning Board is asked to provide an advisory
opinion on the zoning regulation amendment (ZRA). In addition, there
is a Zoning Board, which consists of the members of the County
Council reconstituted as the Zoning Board. The Zoning Board handles
piecemeal map Amendments and development plan approvals.

Piecemeal map amendments are those amendments that involves only
zoning map and comes from an applicant requesting the change to a
particular piece of property. A piecemeal map amendment is "based
on findings as to administrative facts regarding specific criteria
for change in zoning," and the criteria are not important here.
Development plan approvals are required by the Zoning Board in some
districts. These cases are considered quasi-judicial in nature, so
the members of the Zoning Board must maintain a degree of heightened
caution with respect to outside interference to preserve due process
for the applicant. This is the same standard we have to adhere to
[on the Board of
Appeals](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals).

This review only considers charter counties in Maryland and also
does not include Baltimore City, which is a charter county for some
purposes. Reviewing how other counties handle this, we can see that
there are solutions all over the place, so to speak. And Howard
County does not fit well with any other established patterns.

For instance, only Baltimore County seems to maintain the zoning
regulations as a separate codification of the county ordinances.
All other counties include their zoning regulations as subchapters
of the overall county ordinances. All of the counties, as near as
I can tell, place zoning regulation amendments in the hands of the
county council for each county. This makes sense, because the zoning
regulations are considered part of the county code. If the zoning
regulations were considered a separate and subordinate body of
regulations to the county code, then then it could be changed through
administrative processes. That's just not the case though in any
Maryland charter county.

The more interesting thing is how zoning maps are amended across
charter counties. Wicomico, Talbot, and Harford counties place map
amendments in the hands of county councils. This makes sense because
they are smaller counties and we can presume have fewer demands.
Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties use designated hearing
authorities. That hearing authority may or may not have other
administrative duties, too. Baltimore County places responsibility
for map amendments in the hands of the Board of Appeals.

In Montgomery County, map amendments seem to handled by the District
Council, which is just the members of the County Council reconstituted.
However, the District Council is a part of the bicounty agency, the
Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC).
Prince George's is the other county in the agency. In addition,
other parts of the planning process between the two counties are
entwined through M-NCPPC.

However, in Howard County, many issues spring from the Zoning Board's
role in development plan approvals. That seems to be a unique feature
in a lot of ways in Howard. While the problem of quasi-judicial
standards arise in map amendment cases they arise in development
plan approvals. And to ensure due process, members of the Zoning
Board cannot speak to their constituents about cases before them.
Not speaking to constituents is not the kind of thing Council members
tend to like, because then they feel unresponsive.

[I have said
before](/2019/02/09/howard-county-should-free-the-zoning-board/)
that Howard County should separate the roles of the County Council
and the Zoning Board, for reasons detailed elsewhere. There are two
distinct and separable problems here. First, zoning map amendments
need to be processed. Second, development plan approvals needs to
be processed. That leads us to three potential alternatives to the
_status quo_.

First, Howard County could reestablish the Zoning Board as a separate
elected body. In this alternative, both zoning map amendments and
development plan approvals could be addressed by the new Zoning
Board. However, this alternative presents a number of problems. The
biggest is that Zoning Board members have to get elected and that
leads to the same issue that Council members currently have. Members
of the Zoning Board would be forced to campaign on issues they could
not talk about and would ultimately end up accepting donations from
those who would necessarily be appearing before them. The elected
Zoning Board really solves no problems and creates some new ones.

Second, Howard County could reestablish the Zoning Board as a
separate appointed Board. In this alternative, both zoning map
amendments and development plan approvals could be addressed by the
new Zoning Board. Appointments would be made by the County Executive
and subject to County Council confirmation. This is the process
used for almost all county boards unless there is some specific
requirement otherwise. This would provide political insulation for
the Zoning Board since decisions could be made without having to
worry about electoral consequences. This is a critical feature in
an agency that must be concerned about due process. That is, not
all decisions will be popular, but they must be legal and political
insulation protects the process. This is a viable alternative.

Third, Howard County could abolish the Zoning Board and transfer
its functions to other bodies. Development plan approvals should
almost certainly be transferred to the Planning Board under this
alternative. The Planning Board has the expertise and experience
to handle development plans as they are not terribly different from
the other approvals expected of the Planning Board. Zoning map
amendments could be transferred to either the Planning Board _or_
the Board of Appeals. Both bodies have the expertise and experience
to address zoning map amendments and there are benefits to either
body processing zoning map amendments. In either configuration,
this is a viable alternative. This also has the advantage of not
creating a new bureaucratic process as both the Planning Board and
Board of Appeals have the bureaucratic infrastructure already in
place to take on these roles.

This now leads to the question of what the Charter Review Commission
should recommend regarding the Zoning Board. We must be mindful
that any Charter revision must be approved by two-thirds of the
Council members (four members under the current Council) then be
approved by a majority of the voters at a subsequent general election.
This is a high hurdle, but not unachievable. But the current
arrangement has been established by ordinance and therefore by
Council bill. It is possible to make substantial changes to the
current arrangement through a legislative change, requiring only a
majority of the council (three members) and the signature of the
County Executive.

Unless the Charter Review Commission believes the correct solution
is to reconstitute the Zoning Board as an elected body, then no
change to the Charter is necessary. If the Commission does intend
to create such an elected body, doing that through the Charter does
seem completely reasonable. But this is the worst of all alternatives,
as noted above. The viable alternatives do not require a change to
the Charter to affect and probably should not be enshrined in the
Charter. Finally, it would politically easier to affect a change
via a simple Council bill.

Based on the above, I do not recommend the Charter Review Commission
make any recommendation with respect to the Zoning Board and how
it is structured. Instead, this should be allowed to follow the
normal legislative process, as the result is identical and the
process simpler.
