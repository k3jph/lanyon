When I was a kid, there was a moderately okay to eventually very bad TV show called [seaQuest DSV]() on some network that I can no longer recall.  It's premise was basically Star Trek in the oceans, and had it stuck to that, it would have been much better.  But hey, it had [Roy Scheider](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702/), who I thought was awesome because of [Frank Murphy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085255/) and [Heywood Floyd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086837/).  But whatever.

On Monday, I watched someone working on a speed camera near home.  The speed camera, despite what you may think of it, is a fairly remarkable device.  It can, automatically, determine if you're breaking the law, and is even sometimes correct.  More remarkably, the first patent on a speed camera was [granted in England in 1905](https://books.google.com/books?id=Dt4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA926&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false).  But I first saw such a device on seaQuest.  In this scene, from the second season opener, Scheider's character is driving a motorcycle and scanned by a laser, which reads a license plate on a barcode.  Then, a human contacts him in real time to announce they have already deducted the fine from his account.  I am not sure why the notice could not be automated, too, but whatever:

As bad as speed cameras are, and especially as irritating, since they [do not improve safety](http://iowawatch.org/2014/03/20/contradicting-studies-on-traffic-camera-safety-impact-make-regulation-a-judgment-call/)...let's just hope we don't get to automatic fine deduction.
