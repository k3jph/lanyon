Science has a good article on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.350.6261.616">mathematics in industry across the Pacific Rim</a>.  The article basically says a lot of mathematicians in manufacturing intense areas are leaving academia (temporarily or permanently) to help improve industrial output.  This shouldn't be a surprise, the same thing happened in the West over the last few decades.

This underlies the important question that math teachers are tired of hearing, "When will I ever use this?"  After my first term <a href="/teaching/mathematics">teaching statistics at UMUC</a>, a student emailed me a slide from a presentation she was watching.  It included a 95% confidence interval and a note of surprise that we do this in the real world, too!
