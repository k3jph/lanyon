This morning, Nina, Ducky, and I went down to [APL](http://www.jhuapl.edu/)
to watch the liftoff of the [Parker Solar
Probe](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe),
initially scheduled for 03:53 local time.  It didn't happen, for
reasons I never checked in to, but they will try again here in a
few hours.  The launch vehicle is amazing, a [Delta IV
Heavy](https://www.nasa.gov/content/delta-iv-booster-integration-another-step-toward-first-orion-flight/#.VHxsvDHF9Zs)
that is one of the most powerful launch vehicles ever built.

This is important because, though somewhat counter-intuitive, it is
just as hard to get closer to the Sun, as it is to get away from it.
Or, more precisely, the [latex]\Delta v[/latex], the change in
velocity, to go [latex]n[/latex] meters closer to the Sun is identical
to the [latex]\Delta v[/latex] to go [latex]n[/latex] meters farther
from the Sun.  So a huge rocket is necessary.  _The Atlantic_ has
a great article about this:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0" data-card-type="article-full"><h4><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/parker-solar-probe-launch-nasa/567197/">It's Easier to Leave the Solar System Than to Reach the Sun</a></h4><p>The Parker team studied its options and settled on Venus. In some ways, the new trajectory works out well. With Jupiter, the probe would have come closer to the sun, but it would have made only two passes. With Venus, the Parker Solar Probe will make 24 passes over its lifetime.</p></blockquote>

Of this, though, this passage is striking:

> [A Jupiter-based slingshot] would have required the Parker Solar
Probe to run on nuclear power. But about a decade ago, NASA told
the Parker team it couldnâ€™t build its spacecraft to operate that
way.

This is a big deal.  Because nuclear power does not work in space
the same way it does on Earth.  Not that it can't, but those nuclear
power plants are heavy.  Nuclear in space works because the radiation
produced from something radioactive is quite hot and power can be
generated from that heat.  There are a lot of ways this works and
[Wikipedia has a good summary of
this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator).
Our typical radioactivity source is plutonium-238.  That's where
this gets messy.

Plutonium-238 is not a typical nuclear waste product and has to be
specifically generated.  And the United States did not produce any
from roughly 1988 to 2013, when Parker design decisions were being
made.  Because of this, we effectively ran out of plutonium-238 and
started manufacturing it again in 2013.

This plutonium-238 is really only useful for powering long-distance
and long-running spacecraft, where solar is ineffective.  But it
is also hazardous to make and store.  Keeping our spacecraft fueled
is important though and we need to keep making it so we can keep
going further and further.

Parker, in the meantime, runs on solar, appropriately enough.  And
with luck, the launch will happen in just about six hours...
