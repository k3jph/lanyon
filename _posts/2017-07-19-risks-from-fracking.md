Fracking, properly, hydraulic fracturing, has a number of tradeoffs.
From a purely economic standpoint, fracking is a very expensive way
of extracting natural gas out of the ground. So natural gas prices
must be fairly high in order to support the fracking process. That
said, efficiencies are pushing down the cost, leading to more
potential fracking in even [less efficient gas
fields](https://energyindepth.org/national/efficiencies-reducing-fracking-cost-shale-thrive-amid-low-prices/).

This is all kind of a big deal because the fracking business has
discovered gas fields in the United States sufficient to support
the nation for [more than 100
years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/04/11/permania-100-years-in-the-permian-oil-fields-of-new-mexico-and-texas/#71d6fca36970).
It's worth remembering, at this point, that natural gas was actually
a waste product of oil drilling originally. But having access to
these natural gas resources is a positive in a lot of ways. It won't
lead to cheaper natural gas, but it will push for some measure of
energy independence in the United States.

On the environmental side, however, it's a mess. Fracking works by
injecting water into the shale layer to break apart the sediment,
releasing trapped gas. So far, so good. But the water is frequently
mixed with other solvents to improve the efficiency of the injection.
The other solvents are typically trade secrets, though an [EPA
analysis](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/fracfocus_analysis_report_and_appendices_final_032015_508_0.pdf)
has listed what was discovered in sequestered fluids. In short,
many of them are toxic (though, to be fair, one found was citric
acid, which is fairly harmless).

The additional chemicals, when injected into the ground, may
infiltrate to the groundwater supply. From there, it can hit drinking
water supplies. Because of this, some jurisdictions, such as [New
York](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/naturalgasdrilling_dep.shtml)
and
[Maryland](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-hogan-fracking-bill-signing-20170404-story.html),
have banned fracking, even when it may be profitable to do engage
in fracking for natural gas extraction.
