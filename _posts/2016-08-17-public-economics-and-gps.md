This morning, I was walking to the office and trying to catch a
[caterpie](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Caterpie_(Pok%C3%A9mon))
when I thought to tweet,

> Amazed the GPS network hasn't been crushed under the load of
#PokemonGo users!

When I realized, _Whoa, someone might take me seriously_.  Then I
decided to write a blog post instead.  About GPS.  And using it up.

The Global Positioning System, GPS, is an amazing system.  Technically,
it is not very complicated, but all the individual components are,
if that makes sense.  It was originally envisioned just down the
road from me at the Johns Hopkins [Applied Physics
Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/) and comprises just over 30
satellites in orbit.  These satellites know essentially two things:

1. Where they are, and 
2. What time they think it is.

The time is controlled via very precise [atomic
clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock) and it is sent
out via a radio signal.  Your GPS device, probably a phone, needs
to receive signals from several GPS satellites to work.  The more
it can "see," the better the resolution.  It works by noting the
very slight differences in the time received from different satellites.
Combined with some fancy [alternative
geometry](/2015/12/17/playing-fair-geometry/), you can figure out
where you are.  The satellite doesn't know anything about you and
you don't send your position back.  All of the work happens in your
phone.

But you're not here to read about technology, you're here to read
about economics and public policy.

What makes GPS really special is that it is a nearly perfect example
of a public good.  I've [talked about public
goods](/2014/12/02/public-goods-often-arent/) before, but two
characteristics define a public good:

1. The good is nonexcludable.  This means you can't close the door
or stop someone from using it.  
2. The good is nonrivalrous.  This
means your enjoyment of the good doesn't interfere with anyone
else's.

This is GPS to a T.  That's why the Pokémon GO users haven't harmed
the network.  They can use it constantly and it will not affect
anyone else's ability to use it.  And that's awesome.  The cellular
network is a different story, as are [Niantic's
servers](http://bgr.com/2016/07/21/is-pokemon-go-down/), but GPS
does not care.  That makes a fascinating example of an entirely
man-made public good.

Of course, that does not mean the GPS system cannot be harmed.  Some
[tests caused problems with the
system](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-07/mysterious-military-tests-may-lead-widespread-west-coast-gps-disruptions-faa-warns)
this summer.  And, of course, the United States Air Force, owner
of the GPS network, could just turn it off.  But then they couldn't
use it, either.

Now, what is not commonly known, is there is a second signal that
is encrypted.  The key is only available to United States military
and selected partners.  Therefore, you and I cannot use it.  That
makes that signal, which can provide higher precision and therefore
higher resolution, excludable.  Accordingly, it is called a "[club
good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good)", like a toll road
or a movie theater.  Neat, huh?

The Soviets also developed a system, still functional, called
[GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS), and the European
[Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation))
navigation system is currently under deployment.

My [talk at the Mars Society
Convention](/2016/07/14/again-i-am-going-to-mars/) will be about
the intersection of policy, technology, science, and economics with
an application to building Martian infrastructure.  Please come and
watch!
