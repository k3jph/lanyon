On Monday night, the [Howard County
Council](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/) adopted
[CR18-2019](https://apps.howardcountymd.gov/olis/PrintSummary.aspx?LegislationID=3201),
establishing the octennial Charter Review Commission and its
membership. I am fortunate to be appointed and I look forward to
continuing good work for the county.

The nice thing about Charter Review is that unlike [the Board of
Appeals](/service), there is no requirement to avoid _ex parte_ 
communications. I can talk to anyone about Charter Review, listen 
to anyone, write about it here, and anywhere else. If anyone 
wants to talk about the Charter, feel free to hit me up. I'll 
buy the coffee.
