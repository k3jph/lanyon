Over the last few years, I've spent a bit of time working on
blockchain and blockchain-related issues at
[JHU/APL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/). Last year, at the request of
[DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology), [Maria
Vachino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariavachino/) and I looked
at how blockchain would work in government programs given the
[NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) Federal Information Processing Standards
(FIPS). Our results were published in _IEEE Security & Privacy_ and
you can read them here:

The short version is, the Federal government cannot use blockchain
until an implementation comes along that is FIPS-compliant. However,
the blockchain-like technology, [R3 Corda](https://www.r3.com/),
should be investigated further for government use for immediate
needs.
