Last night, and tonight, Howard County Council [is debating
CB-9](https://apps.howardcountymd.gov/olis/LegislationDetail.aspx?LegislationID=2738),
a bill to prohibit discrimination based on citizenship status in
County affairs.  Here's my testimony:

> Good evening, Chairman Weinstein and members of the Council.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.
>
> I am Dr. James Howard and have spent most of the last five years
as a consultant in law enforcement at U.S. Customs and Border
Protection.  There, my work focused on southern border security,
counternarcotics, and countertrafficking.  I have also been a
consultant to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, working
in fraud detection.  I am here tonight to testify in support of
CB-9.
>
> I support CB-9 because it protects everyone, regardless of race,
color, or immigration status by securing the equal protections
guaranteed under the United States and Maryland Constitutions.
There has been much fear mongering about the outcomes, it is baseless.
I've heard that we will lose federal funding, though some departments
already enforce the proposed policy.  I've heard that we will see
a decline in property values, a frivolous concern, but still not
one born out of experience.  San Francisco is the poster child for
sanctuary cities and its real estate market is the strongest in the
nation.  I've heard threats wielded against supporters of every
stripe.
>
> What this proposal will do is strengthen the existing enforcement
mechanisms the County has.  The Police will have ensured access to
victims and witnesses.  The Department of Planning and Zoning will
be able to better enforce the zoning code.  Social Services may
provide effective services to mothers and children in need.  We
will see a tool of harassment and intimidation stripped from abusers.
We already have adopted this de facto, and Howard County is routinely
rated as a number one community in every imaginable survey.
Guaranteeing these protections will only make us stronger, together.
>
> Thank you, and I look forward to the increased protection this
bill will provide us all.
