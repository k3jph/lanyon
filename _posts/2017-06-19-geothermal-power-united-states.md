Iceland is a really cool place that uses a lot of geothermal power.
Geothermal power makes up [more than a quarter of electric power
in Iceland](https://askjaenergy.com/iceland-introduction/energy-data/)
and the balance comes from hydropower.  I especially love the fact
the runoff from one of those geothermal plants is [used as a
spa](http://www.bluelagoon.com/).  But geothermal works in Iceland
because the entire thing is a volcanic wasteland about to blow.
The United States is not so fortunate.

Also, the United States requires vastly more energy than Iceland.
Iceland's 2015 power generation was [a mere 18,798
GWh](https://askjaenergy.com/iceland-introduction/energy-data/).
In contrast, the United States generated [4,078,000 GWh in
2015](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec7_3.pdf).  That's
a huge difference that might be underappreciated.  The United States
is a huge consumer of energy, but we need to look toward more
renewable resources for power generation.

Remembering that Iceland is a volcanic wasteland, [according to the
Energy Information
Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=3970), the
western U.S. is ripe with potential geothermal locations.  This
makes sense.  There's a lot of volcanos and volcanos are indicative
of underground heat.  On the other hand, I live along that border
between yellow and green in Maryland which means, "no chance" and
"we didn't even bother trying."  Geothermal power is a nonstarter
in most of the eastern United States because the ground just is not
warm enough.  That said, I know a few people with [smaller home-based
systems](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a4597/4331401/)
in West Virginia, where it may be more practical.

Power can be transmitted over some distance, but there are [substantial
losses as distance
increases](http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/).
So having local power sources can reduce the energy lost.  Transmitting
power from the western United States, where geothermal power is
practical, to the rest of the country is probably not possible at
scale.  That's why we are better off with blended energy resources.
We should use noncarbon solutions for power generation at locations
where each is practical, whether it be solar, wind, geothermal, or
nuclear.
