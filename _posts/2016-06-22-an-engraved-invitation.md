It has suddenly become fashionable to assert that children must be
taught cursive handwriting or there has been some sort of failure
in their education.  In fact, here's a New York _Times_ article on
the topic, posted after I had written this.

<iframe src="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/oembed/html/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwell.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F06%2F20%2Fwhy-handwriting-is-still-essential-in-the-keyboard-age%2F" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" title="Why Handwriting Is Still Essential in the Keyboard Age" style="border:none;max-width:500px;min-width:300px;min-height:550px;display:block;width:100%;"></iframe>

I am, here, drawing a distinction between cursive and other handwriting
forms.  I firmly believe children must learn to write, by hand, but
that cursive is not necessarily the best vehicle for learning
writing.  Cursive has a very distinct writing pattern that increases
pressure on downstrokes and decreases pressure on the upstroke.
This makes downstrokes thicker.  However, this style makes a lot
of sense if you're writing with a quill.  Made of a cut feather, a
quill does better on the downstroke and worse on the upstroke,
because the point is asymmetric.  This reduces breakage and
splattering, keeping the quill in shape and making sure ink doesn't
fly anywhere.

Very few people write with a quill, today, so why should we write
like we are writing with a quill?  Modern ballpoint pens, rolling
ball pens, and razor point markers present a smooth symmetric
interface with the paper, as does a properly sharpened pencil.
Having a writing style designed to accommodate the equipment is
essential, and cursive isn't it.  In fact, I write almost exclusively
with a fountain pen (mostly a [Waterman
Expert](http://www.waterman.com/en/45-expert) for the last 6-7
years), with a modern [iridium nib](http://www.nibs.com/article5.html),
which allows ink to flow freely and almost symmetrically, cursive
is not necessary to write properly.

Is abandoning cursive really so terrible, that we can't do it.
Probably not, other handwriting styles have been abandoned before.
[Blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter), staple
of faux-Gothic print, dominated the English language until the mid
1600s.  The English government mandated the use of [chancery
hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_hand) until the 1800s.
Discarding cursive as no longer necessary is hardly a tragedy.
Let's let the kids focus on what really matters:  The content of
their writing.
