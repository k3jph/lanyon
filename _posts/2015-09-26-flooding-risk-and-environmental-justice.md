A [fantastic open access](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/095010/meta) article in _Environmental Research Letters_ explores the consequences of flood risk by socioeconomic group.  The study focuses on the Miami-Dade MSA and provides an assessment showing racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to see increased flood risk that poorer communities:

> Furthermore, the inequitable exposure of neighborhoods with greater percentages of non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics as a whole, and the Hispanic subgroup of Puerto Ricans to inland flooding suggests that these socially vulnerable residents are residing in flood zones that lack indivisible water-related amenities. Amenities associated with coastal flood zones must outweigh the hazards if individuals of lower social vulnerability, such as non-Hispanic Whites and those with lower neighborhood deprivation, reside there. Conversely, racial/ethnic minority and low-income residents are often constrained in their choices for housing location and thus relegated to neighborhoods exposed to inland flood risk that lack water-related amenities.

This is part of a growing body of literature on the distributional effects of natural disasters.  With respect to flooding, there's _[Affordability of National Flood Insurance Program Premiums](https://books.google.com/books?id=gelyCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT134&lpg=PT134&dq=%22Benefits+and+Costs+of+the+National+Flood+Insurance+Program%22&source=bl&ots=pIUVq77OKQ&sig=aNR9rBR3hp6KD5hOYY_Tf0PJf0o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBGoVChMI-uK5tumSyAIVSjM-Ch1XgwdR#v=onepage&q=%22Benefits%20and%20Costs%20of%20the%20National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Program%22&f=false)_, the Massachusetts study [I blogged about in June](https://jameshoward.us/2015/06/04/wealthier-communities-pay-less-for-flood-insurance/), and my own dissertation, among others.
