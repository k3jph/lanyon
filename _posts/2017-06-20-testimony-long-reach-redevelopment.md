Last night, I testified in favor of CR98-2017 and CR99-2017.  These
resolutions are part of the final steps to kick off the Long Reach
redevelopment plan.  See my testimony below.

> Chairman Weinstein and members of the Council, good evening.  I
am Dr. James Howard and I am here to testify in favor of the Long
Reach Redevelopment Plan. Thank you for the opportunity to speak,
tonight.  And, please excuse me Chairman Weinstein, I also want to
thank the four members of the Council who passed CB 2009-29, Dr.
Ball, Ms. Terrasa, Ms. Sigaty, and Mr. Fox, which allowed for a
resident-driven process for revitalization of the Village Centers,
and particularly Dr. Ball, who has always championed Long Reach,
for creating the process that leads us to today.
>
> I have lived in Long Reach for a long time.  I served on the
Master Plan Committee for Long Reach after CB29-2009 was adopted.
Our committee spent a great deal of time, all of it in the Village
Center, discussing the Center, its future, the Village, and Columbia.
In the Village’s plan, we adopted a vision for a center than enhanced
Long Reach.  We asked for a public village green.  We asked for
shops and commercial to support everyday residents.  We asked for
institutional space.  And finally, we asked for residential units
to support the non-residential uses.  The Village Board later adopted
our proposed master plan in 2012.
>
> The Proposed Plan brings us a lively and beautiful implementation
of the vision of Long Reach’s residents.  Orchard offers pedestrian
walkways, retail operations, and sufficient parking to support our
new Village Center.  Orchard also brings us dynamic green space,
community space, and a place to gather and play.  For the first
time, there will be a there there.
>
> This plan sits at a pivotal point in the course of modernizing
Columbia and moving it forward.  Parties looking toward other village
centers and downtown will look at how Long Reach proceeds.  I ask
you to support Long Reach and this plan.
