The Piedmont Province is a geographic region stretching from southern
Pennsylvania southward through Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas,
northern Georgia, into eastern Alabama. The Piedmont consists of a
plateau region bounded on the west by the Blue Ridge mountain range.
On the east, the plateau is bounded by the Atlantic coastal plain.
The eastern boundary has a large drop down to the coastal plain and
because of this, is often the site of inland ports. Baltimore and
Richmond are examples of these ports.

The Piedmont itself is composed of gentle hills along the plateau
without any major peaks or valleys. The ground level varies from
50 meters above sea level to 300 meters above sea level. The geology
itself is diverse across the Piedmont. The bedrock is mostly [slate,
schist, gneiss, quartzite, marble, and
amphibolite](https://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-geology/common-rocks-and-minerals-delaware-piedmont).
The surface soils are generally [unconsolidated sediment and rich
in
clay](http://www.virginiadot.org/VDOT/Business/asset_upload_file465_3529.pdf).
The soil is fertile and farming both tobacco and cotton are closely
tied to the history of the region.

The bedrock itself has low porosity and [is impermeable in many
areas](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_l/L-text4.html). The
regolith and surface soils have much higher porosity and are generally
more favorable for containing subsurface waters. However, the yield
from groundwater wells that do not penetrate the bedrock is generally
lower because [bedrock-penetrating cased well-bores allow for greater
drawdown](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/wsp2242/pdf/wsp2242.pdf#page=55).
Fractured bedrock provides aquifer storage. However, well yield
does not increase with depth greater than 100 meters across most
of the region.

Groundwater recharge varies across the Piedmont Province because
the [primary source of water is local
precipitation](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_l/L-text4.html).
Recharge occurs by infiltration through porous surface soils. This
infiltration passes through to aquifers. Accordingly, subsurface
waters in the Piedmont are mostly disconnected local aquifers and
there are few large-scale aquifers that span large stretches of the
province, with the "best" wells [being along perennial
streams](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/wsp2242/pdf/wsp2242.pdf#page=56).
Natural discharge is limited to seepage into groundwater streams
and limited springs [throughout the
area](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/2077/report.pdf). Other sources of
discharge include transpiration from the regolith through crops and
forests.

The entire region has a bit of a reputation for being difficult to
develop water sources in. And this is important because this region
provides homes to a large portion of the eastern seaboard. Despite
living in this area, my own water comes from the Gunpowder Falls,
North Branch Patapsco River, and the Susquehanna River. Here in
Howard County, the [Planned Service
Area](https://data.howardcountymd.gov/mapgallery/planning/PlannedServiceAreaWater22X34.pdf)
provides water service through the Metropolitan District, which
purchases water from Baltimore. Outside of the District, well-water
provides water supplies. But this is in generally more sparsely
developed areas.
