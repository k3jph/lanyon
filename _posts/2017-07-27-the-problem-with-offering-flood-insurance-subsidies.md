Flood insurance is always on point. I had a letter in [The Columbia
Flier](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/)
on the value of mitigation _vis-Ã -vis_ flood insurance subsidies
in Ellicott City, Maryland. The letter does not seem to be in the
online edition, so here it is. Also, why do newspaper editors like
to turn every sentence into its own paragraph?

> In the July 20th edition, Michael W. Roth argued that the County
should consider flood insurance subsidies for Ellicott City.
("[Examine flood insurance subsidies for Ellicott
City](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-letters-0720-roth-20170720-story.html),"
Letters)

> While I am sure Mr. Roth is well-intentioned, insurance subsidies
would cause more problems than they solve.
>
> Without subsidies, someone must consider the full risk of any
project they are taking on.
>
> If the risk of a project is suddenly held by taxpayers, then we
will encourage people to take risks that maybe they should not take.
>
> County subsidies would make an existing problem worse; as it is,
the Federal government already subsidizes flood insurance for
downtown Ellicott City.
>
> Howard County and its residents are much better off investing in
mitigation that reduces flood risk.
>
> The real return on mitigation is much higher over the long term
as a smaller investment today yields returns for decades down the
line.
>
> In contrast, the real return on insurance subsidies is zero after
the insurance term has expired.
>
> Further, mitigation yields far more bang for the buck and easily
qualifies for funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
