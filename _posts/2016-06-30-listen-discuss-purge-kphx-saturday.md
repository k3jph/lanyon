At 12:40 (EDT) / 9:40 (PST) on Saturday, I will be discussing the
ethics of [_The Purge_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purge)
on [Breakthrough
Entertainment](http://www.breakradioshow.com/show/breakthrough-entertainment/)
on [KPHX in Phoenix](http://www.1480kphx.com/).  While _The Purge_
is a bad horror movie, some of the underlying ethical ideas exposed
raise some interesting questions.  I will also be talking about
some antecedent media that addressed these ideas including ["The
Return of the
Archons"](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Archons_(episode)),
["The Lottery"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery), and
_[The Hunger
Games](http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/the_hunger_games_69765.htm)_.

Tune in to find out more and I will post an MP3 a few days after
the show or listen to the live stream here:
