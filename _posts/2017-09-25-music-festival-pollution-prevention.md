I found the sustainability report for [Bonnaroo](http://www.bonnaroo.com),
the music festival featuring U2, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a
bunch of other bands I am too old to recognize.  These music festivals
are often thought of as long on talk, but [environmental train
wrecks](http://www.laweekly.com/music/trashed-music-festivals-are-environmental-disasters-2614424)
producing an insane amount of trash and human waste.  So I thought
this would be a bit different from, say, another $100 billion
manufacturer, like, say,
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/annual/).  On the other
hand, Bonnaroo is talking to a different audience, so some of the
details are presented differently.

Bonnaroo does not lay out a defined environmental policy either in
their report or elsewhere.  IBM lays it all out in theirs in a full
page of "we shalts" they commit to.  Nevertheless, we can do a bit
to infer Bonnaroos by looking at their activities in context and
seeing what we can tease out.  However, their report does state
simply, "Thanks to all of you 2016 was another banner year as we
work towards being as sustainable as possible."  We can accept this
goal as their policy guidance.

Bonnaroo's major wastes are those related to food service and human
waste.  As a multiday festival with campers onsite, doing things
people do, this is to be expected.  Food service produces a large
amount of trash in the realm of containers, food waste, and biological
waste.  In addition, large musical operations require a substantial
amount of electricity to power the operation.  Their key goals have
been reduction and diversion of wastes in these areas.

One of their biggest successes has been in their "Refill Revolution."
The festival takes place over several days in June in Tennessee,
and those are likely to be hotter.  Festival-goers will consume a
lot of water and their Refill Revolution sold reusable cups to
patrons.  In 2016, Bonnaroo does not say how many were sold but
they estimate 800,000 16-oz plastic water bottles were saved.  In
other areas, they have donated leftover food to local shelters and
composted undonateable foods.  Finally, substantial parts of the
operation are powered by onsite solar farms, reducing electrical
demands from the primary grid.  Their touted statistics are:

* 151 tons of recycling/reuse
* 347 tons diverted from landfills
* 536 tons of wastefood recovery

Bonnaroo does not explicitly state how they have benefited.  Unlike
IBM, they do not showcase their sustainability and environmental
awards.  However, recognition is coming from the outside.  In another
article on musical festival pollution, [Bonnaroo is called out as
setting a standard for
sustainability](http://www.greenphillyblog.com/lifestyle/sustainable-travels/bonnaroo-sets-standard-for-green-music-festivals/).

Based on this information, Bonnaroo seems to be a good P2 practitioner.
But they also have room to improve and they recognize that.  Their
stated goals going forward include farm-to-table food sourced
locally.  Locally-sourced food reduces pollution reduces upstream
pollution from suppliers.  The fact it is trendy among consumers
also helps sell the item.  This underlies a lot of actions to promote
environmental causes among business, I have observed.  They often
benefit either through reduced costs or increased sales.  Not that
there is anything wrong with that.

The one place I do not see mentioned is in managing human wastes.
Of course, people will still have to go the bathroom, so reduction
is, uh, difficult.  But by treating or finding reuse (wastewater
sludge is often used as fertilizer), they could further reduce their
pollution impact.
