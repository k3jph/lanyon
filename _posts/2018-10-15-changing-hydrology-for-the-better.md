The effects of changing hydrology on wetlands have caught my attention
this week.  When I first came to Maryland, I remember hearing [there
are no natural
lakes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/rosenwald-md/post/fact-maryland-has-no-natural-lakes/2012/07/30/gJQAbtgdKX_blog.html?utm_term=.9a66e05b0400),
a story repeated as this odd factoid about Maryland.  Every body
of water we have, that doesn't move, is man-made.  And here in
Columbia, we have three large lakes: Lake Kittamaqundi, Lake Elkhorn,
and Wilde Lake.  We also have a number of smaller ponds, and Jackson
Pond is about a five-minute walk away.

These are absolutely non-natural.  These are overgrown drainage
ditches that the [Rouse Company](https://www.howardhughes.com/)
wisely turned into amenities.  Jackson Pond has a small marshy area
where the stream dumps into it.  At the far end, a weir allows water
to dump out back into the stream...or rather, is the headwaters of
a new stream.  Between the two points, a few hundred meters of
distance provides space for pollutants to settle out.

But these wetlands also provide another important purpose.  Columbia
is a designed city and was designed in the mid- to late-1960s.  This
was the same time flood mitigation became a national issue.  Each
of these ponds and waterways, our 3000+ acres of dedicated open
space, is unbuildable, anyway.  It's all floodplain!  It's kind of
a neat trick.  We get protection from the environmental hazard and
a greener, more pleasant place to live.

In the end, this is a story about how changing hydrology, when done
purposefully and carefully, can be a good thing!
