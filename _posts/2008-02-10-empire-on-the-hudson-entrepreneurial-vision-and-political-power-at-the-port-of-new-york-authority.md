> Jameson W. Doig, _Empire on the Hudson: Entrepreneurial Vision and Political Power at the Port of New York Authority_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001).

Doig presents a history of the Port of New York Authority from its origins until the 1950s. Primarily, the book concentrates on the tenure of executive director Austin Tobin, including biographical information, and his efforts to develop the New York regionâ€™s airports and seaports.  Doig explores the legal and administrative issues surrounding the development of the Authority, and how its development dictated the development of 20th century New York.

Unfortunately, while the book presents the the later history, through the 1990s, the second half of the 20th century is covered in a high-level overview without the depth of character and personality presented earlier.
