This summarizes real risk right here.  Influenza is substantially more likely kill you than Ebola, and people's reactions to Ebola are substantially out of proportion.  I gave a talk a couple of weeks ago on project management, and I ended it with this:

> Since I have a microphone, let me abuse it.  You're not going to get Ebola, but get a flu shot and wear your seatbelt.

The lesson is your response to risk should be response to both the size and likelihood.
