David Smith and I are now talking to each other in blog posts and
it is only a little weird.  Also, I've been traveling and am a bit
behind.  In a [comment on this
post](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/07/understanding-na-in-r.html),
he notes this:

> I suspect the reason why R Core adopted the 0^0=1 definition is
because of the binomial justification, R being a stats package after
all.
>
> I can't think of any defense for NaN^0=1 though...

Well, it turns out there's a good reason.  If we go back C, and try
an experiment, we can observe the following example produces these
results:

{% highlight c %}
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	float test, NaN = sqrt(-1);

	test = pow(0, 0);
	printf("0^0 = %.2f\n", test);

	test = pow(NaN, 0);
	printf("NaN^0 = %.2f\n", test);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compiling and executing on my Intel-based Mac shows that NaN^0 =
1, in agreement with R.  But why?  It goes back to [IEEE
754](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4610935&filter=AND(p_Publication_Number:4610933)),
the standard for floating point arithmetic.  In section 9.2.1, it
is quite clear what the behavior of the power operation should be:

> pow(x, Â±0) is 1 for any x (even a zero, quiet NaN, or infinity)

So the defense of NaN^0 = 1 is that the hardware ate the value.
Or, more explicitly, that's what the standard says the result should
be.  What may be interesting is the behavior of NaN^0 on a VAX or
some other hardware architecture which supports a non-IEEE floating
point format.  However, it may only be interesting for historical
purposes.
