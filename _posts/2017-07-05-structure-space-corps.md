There's been a lot of breathless coverage of the surprise United
States Space Corps being all of the sudden.  Here's a brief listing
of links:

* [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/congressional-panel-puts-plans-for-a-us-space-corps-in-2018-defense-budget/)
* [Russia Today](https://www.rt.com/usa/394936-us-air-force-space-corps/)
* [Space News](http://spacenews.com/space-corps-proposal-becoming-flashpoint-in-dod-budget-negotiations/)
* [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/space-us-air-force-armed-forces-space-mission-a7818001.html)

Really, I could go on for a while, but you get the idea.  But the
most interesting of the pieces was this one in the _National
Interest_:

{% include iframely.html url="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/against-air-force-space-corps-space-belongs-the-navy-21350" %}

The quick summary is that the Navy should own space.  And if you
think about this the way most people would, that makes sense.  In
_Star Trek_, _Star Wars_, and every other major science fiction
story, the space military looks like a navy.  They have admirals
and captains, not generals and colonels.  That is just how we think
of it, so why should it be any different in the real world?

But the Space Corps, as proposed, isn't the space navy, despite how
it may be talked about.  After much digging around, I finally found
the legislation in question.  It's not on
[THOMAS](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2810/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22national+defense+authorization%22%5D%7D&r=1)
yet.  But there's a copy of the [House Armed Services Committee
markup](https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS%20-115HR2810-RCP115-23.pdf)
available from the Rules Committee.  It's the House, just don't
ask.

So what does the bill do?  The bill adds language to Title 10
covering the Armed Services and creates a "Space Corps" with a
"Chief of Staff of the Space Corps" who reports to the [Secretary
of the Air
Force](http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Air-Force-Senior-Leaders/SECAF/), the
head of the Department of the Air Force.  The Space Corps is separate
and distinct from the Air Force, but reports through the Secretary.
This isn't that unusual.  The enabling language for the Marine Corps
creates the Headquarters, Marine Corps within the Department of the
Navy.  The Commandant of the Marine Corps reports through the Chief
of Naval Operations, the head of the Department of the Navy.  As
you can see, consistency in naming isn't very high.  So the creation
the Space Corps within the Department of the Air Force is not without
precedent.

So without discussing the merits of the Space Corps, I would like
to take issue with the _National Interest_ piece.  The reason, and
I understand where they are coming from, I disagree, is that the
parallel isn't there yet.  It's actually worth asking why the Army,
Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force are distinct from each other.  It
doesn't have to do with where they operate.  It has to do with how
they operate.[1.  Which is somewhat dictated by where, but work
with me here.]

There's an old joke about how an army and a navy are different: How
do you get 6000 sailors to turn left?  Turn the wheel.  It underlies
a very fundamental difference between the two types of services.
A naval unit is composed of many different people working together
as the unit.  A ship is not a person.  The fundamental unit of an
army is an individual soldier.  There, to get 6000 soldiers to turn
left, you have to get them all to coordinate.  That's why they have
different types of training.

This gets us to the question of why the Space Corps should be part
of the Air Force.  It's because the Air Force most resembles how a
Space Corps will operate, initially.  We don't have fleets of
spacecraft manned with [1014
people](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)_personnel).
Our largest spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, only had seven seats.
That model isn't changing any time soon.  And that's closer to the
Air Force.  For instance, a B-52 has a crew of five or six, depending
on configuration.

Until the model of space flight moves forward, and I hope it does,
the idea of a space navy will stay on the pages of space opera.
But when the Defense Department goes to space, the Air Force model
is probably the best, for now.
