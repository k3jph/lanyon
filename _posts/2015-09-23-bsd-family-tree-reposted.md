I needed to cite (informally, in a Facebook conversation) a footnote I had written 15-16 years ago in DaemonNews, an old publication dedicated to the [BSD family](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/share/misc/bsd-family-tree) of operating systems.  DN is no longer available, it seems. And that's frustrating, because the article I had written, ["The BSD Family Tree"](/archive/the-bsd-family-tree/) is actually a pretty good resource on how the BSD-derived systems were interrelated.  So I have put a copy up for anyone interested.  

Also, it turns out the footnote didn't say what I remembered it saying.  So what I needed it to say was,

> NeXTSTEP is capitalized, variable, as NeXTstep, NeXTStep, NEXTSTEP, and even OpenStep.

Well, I am sure I told that joke somewhere before.
