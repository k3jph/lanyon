<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">According to Wikipedia</a>, "[t]he decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio between two values of a physical quantity, often power or intensity."  We usually hear it applied to sound.  It is also applied to radio communications.  For instance, your phone usually has a setting that gives the signal strength in decibels.

In practice, this means there needs to be two measured values in order to have a ratio.    The numerator of the ratio is the measured value.  The denominator is a reference value, a standard number we already know.  For measuring sound this [latex]p_0[/latex], or the pressure at 20 micropascals in air.  So when measuring sound,

<center>[latex]L_p = 20\log_{10} \frac{p}{p_0}\,\text{dB.} [/latex]</center>

But this definition implies I could apply it to any other physical quantities provided the base units were the same.  So, being ridiculous, and using Earth as a reference value, we know the mass of Jupiter is,

<center>[latex]M_j = \log_{10} \frac{M_J}{M_\oplus} = \log_{10} \frac{1.898\times 10^{27}\,\text{kg}}{5.972\times 10^{24}\,\text{kg}} \approx 2.5\,\text{dB.}[/latex]</center>

Neat.
