I love Columbia and I am proud to live here with my family.  My wife and I plan to raise our children here because we embrace Columbia values--civility, acceptance, and community.

I have served Long Reach as a volunteer since 2003.  My service as chairman of the Budget Committee has ensured the long term stability of the CA.  I have served on the Art Center Advisory Board supporting the cultural heart of Columbia.  I have worked on many issues with the Village Board and volunteer yearly for the Long Reach Country Fair.  I have also served on a number of state and local advisory committees.

The CA and Long Reach face a number of challenges.  I believe that my experience and commitment to the village has prepared me to help the organization meet these challenges.  I look forward to continue serving Long Reach.
