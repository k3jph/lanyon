Water security is a complex issue with a lot of independently moving
parts.  While the earth's surface is three-quarters water, almost
all of that is ocean, unusable due to its salinity.  There are
limited freshwater resources available for everyday use, consumption
by humans and human food products.  Global climate change is slowing
replenishment of fresh water supplies while there has been no let
up in demand.

In 2012, the [United States created the U.S. Water
Partnership](https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/oes/rls/fs/2012/186581.htm)
(USWP) to help provide access to information about water and provide
outlets for collaboration on water improvement projects.  Of course,
this is only a first step.  In order to ensure a water secure future,
everyone will need to take part.  This means reducing demand for
water supplies, ensuring that freshwater sources are protected for
spoilage through spills and accidents, and creating new technologies
to turn currently undrinkable water into potable water supplies.

Organizations like the USWP and the [Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz
International Prize for Water](http://www.psipw.org/), provide
access to technical information and encourage innovation in the
field.  But these must be paired with resources for deploying and
making water available to the broader world.  The [World
Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) has long provided funding to support
global infrastructure.  Around the world, the problem must be
attacked at different levels.

In the United States, there's more complicated image.  As we learned
from [Flint,
Michigan](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/index.html),
our own infrastructure is not immune to problems.  This is not
isolated either, as Washington, Baltimore, and Chicago also have
lead problems.  But each must be attacked through infrastructure
upgrades and a commitment to solve the problem.  In many ways,
commitment tends to break down when the bill comes due.
