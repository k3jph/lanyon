In _Nanotechnology Demystified_, the authors make a very interesting
point:

> The biggest single challenge for the next few decades is creating
and distributing energy for [10e10] people.

Now, [I've said before, water will be the greatest challenge of
this century](/2014/10/27/water-century/),
but Williams and Adams make a good point.  The fundamental currency
of the Universe is energy.  Think about it, all that money we make?
What do you buy first?  Food.  What do we fight over?  Oil.  A race
of sentient robots arrive from some other galaxy?  They will need
energy.  Yes, energy will be a challenge.

But it is also a challenge we have now.  [We have, essentially, no
useful ways of storing large amounts of
energy.](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/08/why-the-energy-storage-problem-wont-be-a-problem-for-long/)
The lithium ion batteries in our laptops are the best we really
have.  And that laptop won't last more than a few hours.  And after
a year, the laptop's battery will lose 20 percent of its capacity.
In many ways, our energy generation problem is much more solvable.
There's more than enough solar hitting the Earth.  But solar is
hard to capture, hard to store, and kind of hard to transport.
That's why we use gasoline for cars.  The energy is easily carried
around.

This is where nanotechnology comes in to play.  Some have envisioned
using [nanomaterials to create better lithium ion
batteries](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/08/why-the-energy-storage-problem-wont-be-a-problem-for-long/).
These will be less dangerous, cooler, and longer lasting than the
current generation of lithium ion batteries.  In other areas,
[nanotechnology may make hydrogen fuel cells more
effective](https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-in-energy.php).

The most interesting application of nanotechnology in energy may
not be on the supply side, but on the demand side.  Many applications
of nanotechnology create more efficient and better systems that
have a lower energy demand.  Of course, there is a physical limit
to how little energy can be poured into a system and still produce
work, but cutting the requirements would offset many of the energy
production, distribution, and storage problems we have now.
