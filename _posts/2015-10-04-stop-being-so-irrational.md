I am convinced if you study mathematics long enough, you will eventually discover something unsettling.  For me, this moment came in real analysis.  This morning, a friend posted on Facebook, that her five-year old son asked, "Why do numbers never end?"  I gave the stock answer about countable infinity.  And someone else posted a video about Hilbert's infinite hotel:

I never found the hotel terribly troubling, but it reminds me of something else.  And down the rabbit whole we go.  Let's start by establishing 4 propositions:

* We understand that the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number), those numbers constructed using [latex]m / n[/latex], are [countably infinite](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html).  And that's cool.  [Here are several proofs.](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Rational_Numbers_are_Countably_Infinite)
* We also understand the [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number) are [uncountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set).  [Here's a proof from Theorem of the Week.](https://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/theorem-21-the-real-numbers-are-uncountable/)
*  Also, we know that between any two rational numbers, there is (at least) one irrational numbers. Here's a proof from Khan Academy. <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hxqo_DiL3pw?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
*  Finally, we know that between any two irrational numbers, there is a rational number.  [Here is a proof of that.](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/421600/19244) 

This always bothered me.  I was never able to reconcile, in my head, these four points.  I kind of felt like if the density of rationals matched the density of irrationals, then if one is countable so is the other.  Ahh, I eventually gave up and did statistics, instead.
