Humic acid is a component of many different soils and is readily
found in [natural soil
environments](http://www.bioag.com/humicfaqresources/faqforhumicacids.html).
I am also pretty sure this is [forming in my
composter](http://www.thesoilguy.com/SG/HumicAcid), since the thing
is literally leaking compost tea.  Or maybe that's because I put
in too many coffee grounds and it is leaking weak coffee...  That's
not important.  What is important is that humic acid positively
affects the ability of plants to uptake critical nutrients from the
soil.  Because of this, it is [readily available for
purchase](http://www.gardenerspantry.ca/humic-acids.html).

Soil comes in a lot of different varieties, but they are mixes of
three essential textures: [sand, silt, and
clay](https://www.thoughtco.com/soil-classification-diagram-1441203).  Most
"good" soil for agriculture is some combination of the three, but
here in Maryland, we tend to have soil that is [richer in
clay](https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/soils/soil-testing#clay) and
that can make growing things difficult.  We solve that problem by
adding organic matter, like the compost mentioned above.  Of course,
we want them to work together, and the humic acid will start to
seep into the clay.  And the [clay in Maryland is rich in
kaolinite](https://books.google.com/books?id=9xEMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=kaolinite+maryland&source=bl&ots=C7ZZxmsQny&sig=F_wFOsTDrTiXs44NH_Cuy0Zh7N8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkrceg9vPWAhXEQSYKHSU-AhEQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=kaolinite%20maryland&f=false).

The chemical formula for kaolinite is
Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>, and that
last part makes this interesting.  OH is a hydroxyl functional group
and each molecule of kaolinite has four of them, and kaolinite forms
crystalline structures [bonding to each other at these hydroxyl
groups](http://www.clays.org/journal/archive/volume%2047/47-2-174.pdf).
But [like a
tessellation](http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/back-in-holland/fish-and-frogs/),
the outside edge is not connected and those hydroxyl groups are
looking for some action.  That outside edge may experience [protonation
or deprotonation depending on the solution
pH](http://www.clays.org/journal/archive/volume%2024/24-2-88.pdf).  When
the pH increases, the kaolinite will have deprotonated leaving more
[OH<sup>-</sup>] on the outside boundaries of the crystals.  As the
acidity increases, there the crystal edges become more reactive.

When the kaolinite clays are more reactive, the acids, include the
humic acid mentioned above, will interact with the kaolinite,
sticking around to be picked up by the plants in the soils.  If
they do not stick around, the humic acid will simply pass through
without being picked up.  Accordingly, a higher pH in the soil will
facilitate the uptake of humic acid by plants and in turn, increase
the ability of those plants to uptake other essential nutrients
from the soil.

At least, I think that is how this works.
