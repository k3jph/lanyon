Got my shoes shined while waiting for the train this morning.  I routinely wear [black wingtips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogues), and do not shine them often enough.  Having someone else do it is a rare treat.  And while the shine I received is perfectly serviceable, I can do a better job.  Here's why.

Following an application of [shoe polish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_polish), a [brushing](http://www.vanmorrison.com/) removes excess polish and starts the shine.  Your average stand uses a simple rag (sometimes sprayed with water) to put the final buff on the toe and sides.  

I like to use a [microfiber cleaning cloth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfiber#Cleaning) for the final buff.  I've used microfiber buffing for years and restored shoes I thought for too damaged for repair.  The shine is brighter and a minor scuff is easier to buff out.
