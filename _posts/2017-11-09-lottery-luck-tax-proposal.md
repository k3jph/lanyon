The new [Republican tax
plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-gop-plan-would-delay-corporate-tax-cut-until-2019-breaking-with-trump/2017/11/09/92ea07ec-c55d-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.f367cc3d4e0d)
has a lot of people up in arms.  Mostly rightly so, but I had a
realization today about just how bad it was.  Imagine a hypothetical
winner of a $100 million lottery.  That's a nice payday and the
taxman comes along for his share.  The IRS, under the current regime,
takes 39.6% of that, or $39.6 million dollars.  Of course, if one
is wise, one calls a lawyer first, who sets up a [pass-through
entity](http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/businesses-corporations/pass-through-entity-1119),
like a limited liability company or a subchapter-S corporation.
But that's just a matter of doing business.

Now, under the proposed tax plan, there's a change for pass-through
entities.  Under [the proposed
change](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-28/the-trump-tax-reform-s-pass-through-boondoggle),
pass-through income would only be taxed at 25%, regardless of
bracket.  So our lottery winner pays $39.6 million in taxes, unless
the winner pays $100 to start an LLC,{% fn %}
then the tax bill is only $25 million.  A small $100
dollar investment yields an immediate return of $14.6 million.

That's one lucky lottery winner.
