Moments ago, I received an email from the Elizabeth Warren campaign:

> We are thrilled to inform you that your name was submitted to the
Maryland Democratic Party on our approved list of candidates.

I am pleased to announce that I am on the ballot in April as a
representative to the [Democratic National
Convention](https://www.demconvention.com/) as a pledged delegate
for Warren.

Two years ago, I said one day Trump will no longer be president and
we cannot build an entire party around being anti-Trump. We must
also have policies that make America better. I stand by that today.
We have to build a Democratic Party capable of leading the nation.
That is why I am running for delegate.
