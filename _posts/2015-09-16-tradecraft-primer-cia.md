The CIA has on their website a PDF booklet called _[A Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques for Improving Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/Tradecraft%20Primer-apr09.pdf)_.  The booklet reviews methods of intelligence analysis including:

* Alternative Futures,
* Outside-In Thinking, and
* "What if?" Analysis

It's not (as it says in the introduction), a guide to intelligence analysis, but it is a good outline for how and when to use the techniques on business and academic problems.  On a related note, we used _[Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/PsychofIntelNew.pdf)_ by Heuer extensively in my [undergraduate international studies courses at College Park](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/programs/is).  Both are fantastic books and well worth reading for insight on understanding applications of intelligence methods on real-world problems.
