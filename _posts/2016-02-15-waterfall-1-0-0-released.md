Sometime, [approximately forever ago](/2010/05/23/waterfall-charts-in-r/), I put together a small package to produce [waterfall charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_chart) in R.  It provided two functions, one using base graphics and one using `lattice` graphics.  I planned to document this and also create a version in `ggplot`.  I never got around to either and through [bit rot](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bit-rot.html), and an ever evolving packaging system within R, the project fell out of compliance and was kicked off CRAN. 

About a year ago, I converted the [Mercurial repository](https://bitbucket.org/howardjp/waterfall) to git and [posted it to GitHub](https://github.com/howardjp/waterfall).  As a part of this, I also introduced [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) into the tree.  But I didn't move forward.  I took the time today to get the project in line with current CRAN standards, moved most of the documentation to [Roxygen](http://roxygen.org/), and cut an initial 1.0.0 release.

Not bad for a holiday.
