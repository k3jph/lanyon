I was on [Patrick Henderson's Meet the
People](https://www.facebook.com/factorph) across the lunch hour
today and had a great discussion about taxes and some the new changes
coming out of December's tax bill.  We didn't get to discuss as
much policy as one might have liked, but [Yvonne
Bellamy](https://www.facebook.com/bellamytaxservices/about/) was
there to discuss the tax implications for individuals and she did
a magnificent job.  The number one take away she gave was make sure
your tax preparer knows what they are doing!

Anyway, the video was livestreamed on Facebook and you can watch
it below.  If I had known there would be video, I would have dressed
better!
