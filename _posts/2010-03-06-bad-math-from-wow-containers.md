<p>I just saw an advertisement for something called <a href="https://www.wowcontainers.com/">Wow Containers</a> which allows the tops and bottoms of containers to be interchangeable with each other.  So far, this seems sensible.  Then the commercial says, &#8220;with four different sizes, the possibilities are endless.&#8221;  And by endless, they mean sixteen.  You can see the commercial at the link above.</p>
