I'll be speaking at Nerd Nite Baltimore 8 on April 18th.  My talk,
"The Needs of the Many and the Needs of the Few," will explore
ethics in _Star Trek_ and how they apply in the real world:

> In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (WOK) and Star Trek III: The
Search for Spock (SFS), an ethical dilemma was posed. In WOK, Spock
sacrificed his own life to save the ship and his shipmates, explaining
to Kirk, that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
But in SFS, Kirk sacrifices his ship to save Spock, saying, "Needs
of the one, outweigh the needs of the many."
>
> This talk will explain why both statements are ethically correct
and not in contradiction. Further, this talk will explore applications
of these ethical dilemmas to self-driving cars and public policymaking.
