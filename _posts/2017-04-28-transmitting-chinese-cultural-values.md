I've been learning a bit of Asian history, since it is something I
know little about.  One question is about the role of ancient Chinese
culture across other East Asian societies.  Buddhism played a role
in transmitting Chinese cultural and social values to both Korea
and Japan.  This is because the Buddhism that went to Korea and
Japan carried with it a more intensely Chinese form of the philosophy
than the version originally developed in India.

[Grigg's entire
thesis](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Zen-Ray-Grigg/dp/0785811257) is
the Buddhism of Japan, Zen, is derived from the Korean form (Seon),
itself an import of the Chinese Chan form of Buddhism.  But when
the Chan form of Buddhism developed, it had adopted a number of the
more interesting tenants of Daoism.  This created a more spiritual
form of Buddhism, away from the simpler Buddhism that was mostly
agnostic and away from the more complex Buddhism that had (and still
has) a lot of Hinduism grafted on.

Though I think some of this is the lens we use in the West to view
the East.  For instance, Zen is the dominant form of Buddhism in
the West, having come to the United States initially through Japanese
immigrants, but in the United States, it has become even more
distilled and simplified.  In Japan, [it freely mixes with
Shintoism](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674471849), a
religion that is itself native to Japan.

Based on this, I think it is fair to say Buddhism played a role in
transmitting those values, but those values complemented and were
assimilated by existing systems, rather than replaced them.
