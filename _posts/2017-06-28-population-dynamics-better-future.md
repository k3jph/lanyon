Understanding human population growth is important to policymakers
for a variety of reasons.  As a society, we need to be clear about
both our long-term plans and our long-term needs. For instance, if
a society is going to double in size every 50 years or so, then we
need to make sure we have the capacity to produce the resources
necessary to support that every 50.

Hans Rosling was a Swedish demographer who just recently died, but
he'd done quite a bit of work in the area. For instance, [he gave
a TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hansroslingonglobalpopulation_growth)
showing not just how the population was growing but how it was
changing. In short, while the world is growing, living standards
are rising. Depending on how you think about it, you might infer
that resource production is increasing faster than population growth.

There are two interesting things we can learn from this. First of
all, we know that as living standards go up, [population growth
slows](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/StandardsofLivingandModernEconomicGrowth.html).
This is almost obvious, people do not need children to provide a
sort "retirement plan"--children who will take of them and support
them in their old age. On the other hand, [increasing population
also damages the standard of
living](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ebl/ecbull/eb-10-00351.html).

So we can slow population growth by increasing the standard of
living and that means increasing the resource utilization for more
people. But that's tricky. What we really need to do is redirect
that resource consumption curve. First of all, we can push for more
renewable energy source. Obviously, it would not be good for climate
change if 2+ billion people in China and India start producing
carbon at the same rate we do in the United States. So pushing for
electric cars both here and there is a more responsible approach.

If successful, we can use similar models to improve consumption
curves for food, natural resources (aside from energy), and other
consumables. Further, pushing for more reuse and fewer disposable
goods would also long-term population trends. That is what is meant
by sustainability.  But these are decisions that can only be made
by understanding human population dynamics.
