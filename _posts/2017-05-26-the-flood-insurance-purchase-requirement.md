Here's an interesting bit of flood insurance news.  On May 24th,
the [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) issued
an order to [SunTrust Bank](https://www.suntrust.com/) for violations
of the National Flood Insurance Act.  The [order
itself](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20170525a1.pdf)
does not provide a lot of detail, and I have no inside information,
but I can only assume SunTrust was extending loans for property in
the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) without enforcing the flood
insurance requirement, mandated by statute.  This type of adjudicatory
order is rather rare, but here are two examples from the [Comptroller
of the Currency](https://www.occ.treas.gov/), both from 2015:

* [Amory Federal Savings & Loan Association](https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2015-027.pdf)
* [First National Bank of Pennsylvania](https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2015-069.pdf)

These include a bit of detail and claim both institutions were
issuing SFHA-affected loans without requiring flood insurance.

This gets to one of the core reasons flood insurance exists.  The
SFHA-purchase requirement only applies to properties purchased with
a mortgage issued by a Federally-guaranteed institution.  That means
the bank issuing the mortgage must require flood insurance if it
is chartered by the Federal government (OCC), FDIC-insured,
NCUA-insured, or a member of the Federal Reserve System.  That
covers almost every bank and bank-like institution in the United
States.

This requirement is explained by the fact it protects the Federal
government from flood-related losses through banks.  The scenario,
not at all implausible is that a person has a mortgage on a beachfront
home with no insurance.  The house floods and the person has no
recourse for rebuilding, so the person chooses to surrender the
property to the bank and abandon the mortgage.  If that happens,
the bank has a material loss on the loan since the value of the
returned property is unlikely to match the balance of the loan.  So
the NFIP-purchase requirement protects the banking system.
