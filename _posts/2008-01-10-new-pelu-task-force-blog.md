William Erskine has created a [blog for the Howard County Public Engagement in Land Use Planning Task Force](http://howardcountypelu.blogspot.com/).  The blog will record information from the Task Force, including meeting schedules and minutes.  Also, each member of the task force is free to post to the blog.
