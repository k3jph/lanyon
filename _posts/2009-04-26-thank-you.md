The results are in and my opponent won with a vote of 206 to 164.  The final results are reported as 301 to 164, due to the presumptive winner receiving the votes of corporations and developers throughout Long Reach.

I want to thank all of my friends and family who supported me in this endeavor and especially the residents of Long Reach who supported me and voted for me.
