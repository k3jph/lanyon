I've been helping a small team work on some willingness-to-pay
analysis using double-bounded choice survey data. I'll post more
about that soon, but I am writing now to talk about the double-bounded
choice models in R. The
[DCchoice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DCchoice/index.html)
library is really nice and makes the analysis about as simple as
possible. Further, the text _[Stated Preference Methods Using
R](http://lab.agr.hokudai.ac.jp/spmur/)_ is fantastic.

But...the confidence interval bootstrap routine is really slow with
double-bounded choice models. Single-bounded not so much. But it
was taking hours to run, even for only 1000 samples. I was using
[SciServer](http://www.sciserver.org) for running the model and it
gives me 16 cores, so I rewrote bootCI to use them all. The script
is below and you have to have both `doMC` and `foreach` loaded.
There's a new option `threads` that allows you to set the number
of threads to use.
