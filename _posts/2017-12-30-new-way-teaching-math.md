I am teaching [Finite
Mathematics](https://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/course-information.cfm?course=math106)
again this spring. The class is a bit different from other mathematics
courses. We have a rapid fire approach and attack a lot of different
practical problems. Because of that, I routinely [advise students
not to take the class](s2014/07/17/teaching-finite-mathematics/).

I have taught MATH 106 many times, but this time is different. We
will be using the new Enhanced Learning Model (ELM) for this class.
It is designed around demonstrating competency rather than completing
a list of assignments. Of course, for a credentialing class, that
probably makes sense. It uses a modern project-based approach and
students complete a handful of projects that require applying the
ideas and techniques learned from the material. UMUC has a video
about how it has worked out in the Graduate School [you can watch
on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHpk_e8g-FQ).

This is my first time working with the ELM and there will be some
rough spots, some strange stuff, and who knows what else. But I am
looking forward to trying something new here. I also hope that this
will alleviate some of the cheating we are seeing more and more of
at UMUC. Moving the focus off of rote-performance of basic problems
and onto more bespoke projects for each student should make it more
interest for the student and hopefully more meaningful.
