Now that we have established that life is [nearly likely to arise
given the right circumstances](/2018/02/14/life-universe-everything),
we want to know what kinds of microorganisms would have survived
the early Earth.  The [early Earth was not much like the
planet](http://forces.si.edu/atmosphere/02_02_02.html) we have
today.  There was little oxygen, something we intrinsically link
to life today.  Hold your breath for a bit, if you do not believe
me.

The early Earth was, after the surface cooled, a desolate and
terrible place.  The atmosphere was dominated by hydrogen sulfide
and methane, products of geological activity on the young planet.
But the simplest molecules would have formed from the volcanic haze,
a volcanic haze rich in hydrocarbons and organics.  If some of them
could reproduce, that would have been interesting.

If they needed oxygen, they would not have fared well.  They would
have died, quickly, for lack of air.  But the first microorganisms
instead thrived off the hydrogen sulfide, we think.  They consumed
it.  And mixed it with sunlight.  Oh, and as a byproduct, created
oxygen.  Descendents of these first bacteria [are still around
today](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanointro.html).  They
are also the first life we can find in the fossil record.
