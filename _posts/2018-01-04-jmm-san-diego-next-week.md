Next week I am going to be in [San Diego for the Joint Mathematics
Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) which is always
fun.  I will have a talk in the [MAA General Contributed Paper
Session on History or Philosophy of
Mathematics](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_program_thursday.html#2197:MCPGENVB)
on mathematics and statistics and their relationship.  This stems
from many years teaching both subjects and coming to some conclusions
about them both.  Here's the abstract for "Two Fields Separated by
a Common Language," which will be Thursday morning at nine:

> This talk will explore the parallel development of mathematics
and statistics as fields. Further, it will show how the language
of mathematics permeates statistics. Next, this talk will provide
a comparison to physics as a field that uses mathematics as a
toolkit, but not as a core experience. Finally, this talk will argue
that statistics cannot be considered a branch of mathematics and
is instead an independent field along with the implications of such
a decision on pedagogy.

Then on Friday, I will be moderating the first half of the [MAA
General Contributed Paper Session on
Topology](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_program_friday.html#2197:MCPGENVU).
The program for the topology session looks incredible, but I am
most interested in a talk by [Zach Sorenson](https://github.com/Zaymer)
on whether knots can be automatically classified by neural networks.
So that should be really interesting.
