Jason Kottke has one of the oldest blogs and recently posted a
curious bit called ["What does living in a dictatorship feel
like?"](https://kottke.org/18/01/what-does-living-in-a-dictatorship-feel-like)
This post explores what many I know on the left are feeling, about
the long slippery slope we are sliding down. Of course, it is worth
noting that many I know on the right felt the same way from 2009
to 2017. Let's set aside which side is right, as that's a silly
debate to have right now. But Kotte includes this curious paragraph
at the end:

> I don’t know about you, but Trump and the Republican Congress
working to "postpone the 2020 elections until its lawyers are
finished investigating something or other" seems like a completely
plausible scenario. I would not be surprised if we see conservative
pundits start floating this idea, slowly normalizing it over a
matter of months until it seems like a plausible option. After all,
it’s much easier for Republicans to remain in office if they got
rid of those pesky elections (in lieu of gerrymandering and voter
ID laws).

This, to me, is fascinating. Not because of the blatant power grab,
which I wouldn't put past either party, but because of how difficult
it would be to pull off. Let's assume the Congress and/or the
President declared that the election of 2020 must be postponed due
to whatever reason and let's now game that out. The result is quite
fascinating.

It is reasonable to assume there'd be some sort of outcry. It would
take at least an act of Congress because the date of election for
representatives, senators, and electors are specified in [2 U.S.C.
§ 7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7), [2 U.S.C. §
1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1), and [3 U.S.C. §
1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1), respectively. That
may not work out, but if these code sections were abrogated, then
states would be free to set their own dates of election. And,
certainly, even if told it were too risky to hold an election,
certainly, some states would _anyway_.

First, let's look at how this would affect the House of Representatives.
It is first important to understand how the House of Representatives
is organized. The House is not what we call a "continuing body."
Every House of Representatives is "new." Even if all the same members
were elected, the body is new. Because of this, the House must, in
a sense, bootstrap itself. The first thing a new House does are
three key things:

1. They elect the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
2. They elect the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and
3. They adopt rules to govern the proceedings of the House of
Representatives.

The Speaker and Clerk are probably the same people they were in the
last House of Representatives and the rules are usually adopted as
the last rules, with any amendments the House shall agree to. That's
just a matter of convenience, and it is all covered in [1 Deschler's
Precedents §§
1-10](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V1/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V1.pdf)
and [1 Hinds' Precedents §§
1-283](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V1/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V1.pdf).
The reason for this is that all representatives' terms expire at
the same time. Per the [Twentieth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt20_user.html#amdt20_hd1),
all representatives' terms expire at noon on January 3rd, of
even-numbered years. This is important that there is no provision
to continue in office. Many appointed positions at different levels
allow that a term shall continue until a successor is appointed and
qualified. For instance, this language exists in [28 U.S.C. §
541(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541), covering
the office of United States Attorney:

> Each United States attorney shall be appointed for a term of four
years. On the expiration of his term, a United States attorney shall
continue to perform the duties of his office until his successor
is appointed and qualifies.

This is a fairly common statutory construction. This keeps a vacancy
from happening under normal procedures, though nothing prevents a
United States Attorney from resigning after his or her term has
expired but before the appointment of a successor. But for the
representatives, they are done at noon, no matter what. That's why
they are sworn in again every two years.

Back to our hypothetical, some states have held elections for
representatives. They would proceed to their meeting (it does not
have to be in the Capitol or even in Washington) and begin organizing
as though it were any other Congress. But in our hypothetical, only
some states have sent representatives...some of whom were probably
already members of the House. It has happened before that [states
declined to send representatives to
Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_United_States_Congress#House_of_Representatives_4);
we all know how this worked out: [my ancestors killed 290,000
traitors for this indiscretion](https://www.civilwar.org/). Following
the organization of the new House of Representatives, there would
be two bodies both claiming to be the legitimate House of
Representatives. Oddly, this is not a constitutional crisis. The
Constitution is quite clear that the new House is the legitimate
House of Representatives.

The Senate is more interesting. As we all know, only one-third of
the senators are elected every two years. Obviously, two-thirds of
the senators stay in the Senate following the election. Because of
this, it is often argued that the Senate, unlike the House of
Representatives, is a continuing body. That is, while there is a
new House of Representatives every two years, this is the same
Senate today as first met in 1789, just with different members.[1.
Some [dispute
this](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2805&amp;context=facpubs).]
The difference may seem semantic, but there's a huge difference in
practical application. I can, without much work, dig up more than
2000 pages on how to organize a new House of Representatives, which
I've only briefly summarized above. For the Senate, the entirety
of its organizational statements from [Riddick's Senate Procedure:
Precedents and
Practices](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-RIDDICK-1992/pdf/GPO-RIDDICK-1992-42.pdf)
is:

> The day prescribed by the Constitution for the beginning of a
regular session of Congress does not arrive, under the universal
practices of the Senate, until the hour of 12 o'clock meridian of
that day.

In other words, senators should not be awakened too early and must
get their beauty sleep. Well, I can live with that. So, a bunch of
new senators come in to claim seats. They have to go to the Senate
as constituted and present credentials to be sworn in. The Senate
is now in a bind, with two people claiming each of several seats.
The Senate is the sole judge of its own qualifications, and hence,
elections. Like the representatives, senators' terms also expire
at noon on January 3rd, every six years. For one-third, they are
no longer members but it is up to the existing Senate to admit the
new members. Of course, the prior members must depart, but hey,
this is a power grab, remember? The Senate would, if failing to
seat the new members and remove the old, at least, lose legitimacy.
Regardless, while we do not end up with two Senates, we do have one
very messy Senate, likely paralyzed by its own in-fighting.

There is also the possibility that those prospective new senators
may choose to organize their own Senate. Perhaps interestingly, the
Constitution is also clear that the old Senate is the legitimate
Senate, just the opposite of the analysis in the case of the House
of Representatives.

This all takes us to the election of the President and Vice-President[2.
As an aside, the title of the "Vice-President" actually has a hyphen
in it. Get it right, people.] Any states organizing a presidential
election and holding a meeting of electors would presumably publish
results. Electors' meetings for each state are held within the state
and the results forwarded to Congress. The official count happens
on January 6th, _after_ the new Congress has settled in a bit, by
a joint session of both houses. The problem is, in this scenario,
multiple organizations are claiming to comprise the Congress. And
then there's [3 U.S.C. § 15](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15)
which states, among other things:

> The Senate and House of Representatives shall meet in the Hall
of the House of Representatives at the hour of 1 o’clock in the
afternoon on that day, and the President of the Senate shall be
their presiding officer.

As we all know, a majority of electors is required for election to
the Presidency. I think it is unclear whether that is a majority
of electors voting or a majority of all seats in the Electoral
College. If it is the first, which the Constitution kind of suggests
in the [Twelfth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxii), then
(assuming a majority of electors was attained), we have a legitimately
elected president who is unable to get an official vote count and
certification. But, the President does not have to be sworn in to
take office, as we have observed many times. Therefore, the new
President would take office at noon on January 20th.

If it is the second case, then the House must hold an election.
Conveniently, there's a new House of Representatives who would claim
that right and they would elect a president. The problem here is
that a quorum of the House for this purpose is at least one
representative from two-thirds of the states. That does not seem
likely under these circumstances, though you never know. Then the
presidency would fall to the Speaker of the House (new House) at
noon on January 20th.

The end result is that you would have two organizations claiming
to the House of Representatives, two people each claiming to be the
President, and a thoroughly disrupted Senate. This is a mess
surpassing any other seen in the United States before, and I strongly
suspect even this administration would not want to risk so much
uncertainty.

However, Jason Kottke is an otherwise sane person. And the fact
otherwise sane people have expressed concern at this potential shows
more about how broken our country has become. And that is the biggest
worry of all. At some point, our nation needs to heal. I don't know
how to do that.

**Edit:**  Here's a [link to a related
piece](https://ricochet.com/archives/postponing-elections-and-constitutional-law/)
by John Yoo, who elaborates on the constitutional aspects of states
choosing election dates, something I pretty well glossed over.  By
and large, he comes to the same conclusion I do, though in a different
context.  John Yoo is a well-respected Constitutional lawyer.  On
the other hand, he also wrote the [infamous, immoral, and obviously
incorrect torture
memos](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html).  So
now I am questioning my logic.
