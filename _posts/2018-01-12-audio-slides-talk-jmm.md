I gave my presentation yesterday at [the Joint Mathematics
Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) about the
differences between mathematics and statistics and what it means
for learners.  This led to quite a bit of discussion about the
structure of modern mathematics departments, which ones include
statistics and which ones are separate from statistical education.
Of course, we strongly suspect money and funding is a driving factor.

All in all, I drew a line in the sand between the concepts of [formal
sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science), those which
start with axiomatic frameworks and derive results from those
frameworks, and [natural
sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science), those
driven by theory but confirmed by experiment.  Statistics and
mathematics, both formal sciences, maybe kind of sort of lumpable
into one category.  On the other hand, physics, like statistics,
relies on mathematics but is not often grouped with mathematics.
Of course, this is based on departmental structure, which is
arbitrary, at best.

The big question, of course, is how this touches on instruction.
I see a great many students who tell me how afraid they are of math.
I think it may be that formal sciences require a different kind of
thinking than the natural sciences and that motivates some students
[anxiety surrounding mathematics and
statistics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/talking-apes/201703/how-overcome-math-anxiety).

Being awesome, I captured the audio with my phone and overlaid it
on the presentation, which you can now [watch on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r56kpdTuG_Q), or click
below.  Unfortunately, I stopped recording before the questions.
