I am teaching calculus again this fall after a few months off from
teaching.  This will be interesting.  Last spring I taught calculus
for the first time and it was the first time in a while I had taught
a new class.  One thing I am looking forward to is redeveloping
some of the assessment material.  When teaching an online class it
is harder and harder to reach out to students and ensure they are
learning something constructive.

One of the ways I have addressed this is to develop assessments
(think quizzes and tests) that really capture new information.  I
do this by asking the student to solve a problem.  Not only do they
have to identify how to resolve the answer mathematically, but they
also must set up the problem mathematically.  This forces an
application and turns away from unfortunate "plug-and-chug" problems.
Generally, like to have as few of these as possible.
