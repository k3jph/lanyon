[Two years after I wrote my big grading
rubric](/2014/06/12/my-first-math-assignment-rubric/) in our
Desire2Learn platform, it has become increasingly clear it is
insufficient for effective grading.  That's not to say it is bad,
but it is both too complicated and too simple to work.  The biggest
problem with it is that it is too subjective.  The default comments
do not align with actual issues, often, and the whole thing just
needs updated.

I was recently talking to a former high school math teacher and he
told me about his old grading rubic.  It's far simpler, but it
directly and objectively quantifies the three critical parts of
solving a math problem:

1. The Set-up
2. The Calculation (_i.e._, showing your work)
3. The Final Result

So the new rubric, for every problem, delivers up to six points,
two for each of the three parts.  This also solves a long-standing
problem I have had with the old rubric.  There is no reasonable way
to grade a problem where the student has written down the correct
answer, and nothing else.  Now, that's worth an explicit point.
The three facets are graded in parallel, rather than in serial.
It's more flexible, and it should allow me to grade more effectively.

The exact implementation of the rubric comes from _How to Evaluate
Progress in Problem Solving_, by By [Randall Charles, Frank Lester,
and Phares O'Daffer](https://www.nctm.org/store/Products/How-to-Evaluate-Progress-in-Problem-Solving/).
I have two [precalculus](/teaching) courses this fall.
The first is wrapping up in two weeks, and uses the 2014 grading
rubric.  The second starts in three weeks, and I will pilot the new
rubric there.
