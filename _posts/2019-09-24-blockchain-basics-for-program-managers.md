During the last few years, blockchain has sucked a lot of air out
of the room with respect to security and systems design. Among other
things I have heard include [blockchain will cure world
hunger](https://medium.com/kingsland/how-blockchain-is-solving-the-world-hunger-crisis-8b2f438f2a35),
[blockchain is the future of
colleges](https://www.bcdiploma.com/index.html), and something about
[blockchain is the future of Social
Security](https://medium.com/asurenetwork/blockchain-as-the-future-of-social-security-intro-1-5-2a600e64ac7b).
All of this, and a lot more nonsense can be found here:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-type="article-full"><h4><a href="https://decrypt.co/4936/ridiculous-things-blockchain">The Ten Most Ridiculous Things "On the Blockchain"</a></h4><p>When you put a thing "on the blockchain," you're not actually putting it "on the blockchain." Nothing is "on the blockchain." The "blockchain" doesn't exist. Instead, what you're really doing is "notarizing information about a thing using a database distributed across a network of nodes, which is sometimes called a blockchain."</p></blockquote>

Blockchain will not cure cancer and it will not do your laundry.
But that does not mean it does not have some uses. For government
IT managers, understanding what blockchain is, how it works, and
what its role in the data storage ecosystem is critical for evaluating
enterprise architectures and proposals for new systems. Accordingly,
at [JHU/APL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), we worked with DHS to develop
a white paper to do exactly that and I am quite happy to say it was
published in the _Journal of Information Technology Management_,
last night.

The most fun part of this is figure 2\. DHS shared our flowchart
with NIST and they put it in [NISTR
8202](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8202/final), and
they put it everywhere!

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-type="article-full"><h4><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nist+blockchain+flowchart">nist blockchain flowchart - Google Search</a></h4><p>blockchain; consensus model; cryptocurrency; cryptographic hash function; ... has been investigating blockchain technology and has created a flowchart to help ...</p></blockquote>

Anyway, you can read the paper in the latest issue of _JITM_, here:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="66f8489580e04fc4a88a724eb5058bb3" data-card-branding="0"><h4><a href="http://jitm.ubalt.edu/XXX-3/article3.pdf">(null)</a></h4><p>(null)</p></blockquote>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

It is aimed at government managers, but, really, every IT manager
should read it!
