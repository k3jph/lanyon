I am sitting in a session at JSM 2016, and will be presenting my
talk tomorrow.  While this is pure public economics and applicable
to almost any benefit-cost analysis, this talk grew out of an
analysis of flood mitigation and recovery evaluation.

It's a speed presentation, meaning I get basically 5 minutes, then
an electronic poster.  It's my first time doing this style of
presentation, so I am using the same slides for both the presentation
and the electronic poster.
