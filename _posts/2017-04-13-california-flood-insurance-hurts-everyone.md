California is considering adopting its own flood insurance scheme,
according to this news report:

Apparently, California residents have paid more than $3B more into
the program than those residents have received since the NFIP
started.  So the plan is to exit the NFIP statewide, and start a
state-run flood insurance program.

Now, California has some expertise in this area. The [California
Earthquake Authority](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/) provides
a state-run earthquake insurance regime for California residents.
Flood insurance is not, at its core, radically different, and so
California could apply its own gained experience to the flood
insurance problem.  And that's cool.

The downside to this idea is that both the risk pools become riskier,
overall.  Insurance works by spreading risk across both space and
time.  While NFIP policies are very concentrated in Florida,
California completely withdrawing from the program will increase
the correlated risk for the NFIP, overall.  Further, the California
flood insurance risk pool with also have higher correlated risk
than the NFIP overall.  Both programs together are a larger problem
the NFIP alone.

It's kind of like the [Will Rogers
phenomenon](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198506203122504), only
everyone loses here.
