The [virtual bumblebees](/2015/03/14/introducing-my-bumblebees/)
are now available for download under an [MIT
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  The bees were
kinda/sorta always available, but I have clarified the licensing.
To celebrate, the [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/)
has published a software abstract, "[Virtual Bumblebees Artificial
Life Simulation](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00256)."

The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is a great project that
aims to be "a developer friendly journal for research software
packages."  The overall idea is that research software should
occasionally be able to stand alone as the outcome of a research
project and in this case, it fit the bees perfectly.  So I was quite
happy to submit this and see it be published!
