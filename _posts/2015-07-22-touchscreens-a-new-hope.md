About three months before Beatrix hatched, I wrote that I might have a disease I called "[touchscreen HCI disorder](https://jameshoward.us/2012/01/05/touchscreen-hci-disorder/)."  She's now three and I asked her to help me set up an initial vector for my [Bumblebees talk](https://jameshoward.us/2015/06/21/im-going-to-mathfest/).  She started poking the screen on my laptop and, since it's not a touchscreen, got frustrated when it didn't work.  Clearly, touchscreen HCI disorder is genetic.
