It's an older story, but here's [one on textbook prices and what
we can do about
it](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/students-706018-book-text.html).
The short version is that even your professor thinks the $300 price
tag on a textbook is ridiculous and we need better solutions.  Some
professors are creating custom textbooks or bulk purchasing
arrangements.  Almost all of UMUC has gone to online learning
resources that are freely available.  It's had some downsides, but
the upside is there, too.

When I taught [public finance for the University of
Baltimore](/teaching/public-affairs/), I reviewed four or five
textbooks and one was [head-and-shoulders above the
rest](http://edu.cengage.co.uk/catalogue/product.aspx?isbn=1285173953).  Of
course, it was also the most expensive.  It clocked in at $330 in 2015. 
And that's untenable, so I sent this email, or a version of
it, to the list of registered students once a month for four months
before the class began:

> I know I had a few of you in PUAD 702 this spring.  For those of
you who do not know me, I am James Howard and I will be teaching
PUAD 701 this fall.  I want to take a minute here and talk to you
about the textbook.  I just posted the textbook, David Hyman's
Public Finance, to the required list.  It's a very good textbook.
It's also $330.  And that's going to be difficult for probably
everyone.  So I am writing now with some important advice.  *The
important advice is don't buy it.*
>
> There're a lot of options out there to solve this problem.  I
think the cheapest I have found is that you can rent the last edition
(electronic) from Amazon for about $65.  Or you can buy it used for
less than $35.  And I have no problem with you using the last
edition.  It's from 2010 and the world hasn't changed that drastically.
You can also rent the newer edition, if you're so inclined, for a
lot more.  In fact, Amazon provides a lot of options.  Here's a
link for the 10th Edition rental and purchase:
>
>    http://www.amazon.com/Public-Finance-Contemporary-Application-Theory/dp/053875446X/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0NNN7ZZJMC26Q9N0XM97
>
> Barnes and Noble also provides a variety of inexpensive options,
but they do cost more than Amazon.  Regardless, there's no reason
to drop $330 on this book.  If you know of anyone signing up for
this class, please feel free to forward this email to them.  I will
probably send it out one or two more times before the start of
class, as well.
>
> You could probably get by with the 9th Edition, too, but I haven't
verified it yet.

Now, that's pretty blunt and it's important to understand that,
like most subjects, public finance had not changed substantially
enough to warrant not using the older textbook.[1.  There's a
credible argument about public finance and health care, but that
is also still in flux.]  I am not sure what the publisher, and for
that matter, the University, thinks of this strategy, but cutting
nearly 90% off the price a textbook can be the make-or-break price
for a student.  Especially since that is $300 dollars off in a class
that cost only $2,377 to attend.[2.  Tuition and fees for three MPA
credits in 2015-2016]

The kicker, of course, is that I said this again the first night
of class.  Most students, not noticing the email, had gone ahead
and paid full freight.
