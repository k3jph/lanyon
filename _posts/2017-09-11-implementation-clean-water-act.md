The federal [Clean Water
Act](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act) is
a collection of laws passed by Congress that together form the
principal federal law on preventing water pollution. This includes
permanent lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and other [nonintermittent
bodies of
water](https://web.archive.org/web/20061007093911/http://www.osmre.gov/coalex/coalex97.htm).
Passed in 1972, over the [veto of President
Nixon](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3634), the
act was later amended in 1977 and 1987, and is administered by the
[Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/), who has
rulemaking and enforcement powers under the Clean Water Act. The
Act addresses surface water contamination, focusing on wastewater
treatment and pollution sources affecting navigable waters of the
United States.

The Act encourages the EPA to work with state and local governments
to reduce pollution to surface waters from wastewater treatment
plants. Wastewater, that is, sewage and
[greywater](https://greywateraction.org/greywater-reuse/), was often
minimally treated, if treated at all, before being dumped into a
nearby water outlet, such as a river or lake. As sources of freshwater,
this sewage dumping fouled the surface water that other communities
were using to drink. In the 1800s, [this led to cholera
epidemics](http://bicetech.com/dbice/Schell/German%20Prodistent%20Orphanage/Cholera%20Cincinnati.pdf),
and later to water that was more expensive to treat before drinking.
So the Act allows the EPA to provide grants of just over 50 percent
of a project's cost to local jurisdictions to improve or build new
wastewater treatment systems. The balance is typically paid for by
state and local government. By substantially reducing the capital
cost of new plants, the Act encourages local governments to better
their treatment systems.

For other surface water pollution types, the Act looks at point
sources of pollution and requires [permits from the
EPA](https://www.epa.gov/npdes) to discharge anything into surface
waters. Point sources are individual effluent flows directly into
a body of water. This could be the wastewater effluent in a treatment
plant or direct discharge from industrial sources, like manufacturing
or mining. In exchange for the permit, the permit holder must meet
certain minimum standards for the treatment of the discharged waste.
Failure to meet these requirements or obtain a permit before discharge
can lead to [civil fines and criminal
penalties](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement).

The final leg of the three-legged stool is the management of nonpoint
pollution sources. Nonpoint sources are those less obvious but
include municipal stormwater runoff, agricultural stormwater runoff,
and [industrial stormwater](http://www.pneac.org/stormwater/). The
Clean Water Act addresses nonpoint pollution sources by giving the
EPA authority to make grants and regulations affecting these runoff
sources. For instance, the EPA and states have enacted total maximum
daily load (TMDL) for certain [nutrient
categories](/2017/07/10/eutrophication-reduction-local-limits/) in
runoff. Further, the EPA can make grants to local jurisdictions to
improve stormwater treatment before it is released into surface
water bodies.

In the Clean Water Act, Congress and the EPA have a wide swath of
tools available for reducing pollutant release into surface water
bodies. These include economic incentives, through grants, to take
action reducing pollution. And it also includes economic disincentives,
through fines, to corral those who are polluting waterways. Finally,
for the worst offenders, the EPA can seek criminal penalties include
prison. Like many environmental problems, surface water pollution
is best approached through a blend of incentives and disincentives
to encourage proper behavior.
