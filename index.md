I am a scientist at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/). Previously, I worked for the [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System](http://www.federalreserve.gov/) as an internal consultant on scientific computing. I have also been a consultant to numerous government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the President, and the United States Department of Homeland Security. I am a passionate educator, teaching mathematics and statistics at the [University of Maryland Global Campus](http://www.umuc.edu/) since 2010 and have taught public management at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/), [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), and the [University of Baltimore](http://www.ubalt.edu/).

I am fortunate to [play in everyone else's backyard](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html). My most recent published scholarship has modeled the population of Earth-orbiting satellites, analyzed the risks of flood insurance, predicted disruptive events], and analyzed the risks of blockchain technology. I have written [two books](/books/) on my work and co-edited two more.

In my spare time, I serve Howard County, Maryland, as [a member of the Board of Appeals](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals) and the [Watershed Stewards Academy Advisory Committee](http://howardwsa.org/) of the [University of Maryland Extension](https://extension.umd.edu/howard-county). Prior volunteer experience includes providing economic advice to the [Columbia Association](http://www.columbiaassociation.com/), establishing an alumni association for the [College Park Scholars Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, and serving on numerous public and private volunteer advisory boards.
