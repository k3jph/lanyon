I am a member of the senior professional staff at the Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC, a university-affiliated
research center. In addition, I am an adjunct faculty member at the
Central Michigan University, the Pennsylvania State University, and
University of Maryland Global Campus.

In the last three years, I have received extramural research support
from the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment,
sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

I also hold appointments from the Howard County, Maryland, government
and a commission from the State of Maryland in the Maryland Defense
Force.

Finally, I have published books with Chapman & Hall/CRC Press,
Springer Nature, and Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.
