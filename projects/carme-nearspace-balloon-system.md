## Introduction

The Carme Project is a series of Arduino-based high-altitude balloon
flights.  The goals of the Carme Project are several.  First, we
intend to use Arduino to build a simple transmitter that can tell
us where the balloon is.  There are signals sent.  First, there is
an APRS telemetry signal that can be received by the existing network
of ground-based high-altitude balloon receivers.  Second, we are
going to broadcast a Morse-code signal that can be picked up by
anyone with a standard FM radio.  Both transmissions will take place
in the 70cm amateur radio spectrum.
